"101",345,"very good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"102",345,"waiter, and he said it was called ""paprika hendl,"" and that, as it was a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"103",345,"national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"106",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"107",345,"Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"108",345,"British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"109",345,"regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"110",345,"country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"111",345,"nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"112",345,"extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"113",345,"Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"119",345,"here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"120",345,"travels with Mina.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"121",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"122",345,"In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"123",345,"Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"124",345,"descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"125",345,"East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"126",345,"from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"127",345,"the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"128",345,"read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"129",345,"horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"130",345,"imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_Mem._, I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"131",345,"must ask the Count all about them.)","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"132",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"133",345,"I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"134",345,"all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"135",345,"window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"136",345,"the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"137",345,"still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"138",345,"knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"139",345,"I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"140",345,"which they said was ""mamaliga,"" and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"141",345,"very excellent dish, which they call ""impletata."" (_Mem._, get recipe","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"142",345,"for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"143",345,"before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"144",345,"the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"145",345,"before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"146",345,"more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"147",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"148",345,"All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"149",345,"beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"150",345,"top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"151",345,"rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"152",345,"of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"153",345,"running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"154",345,"station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"155",345,"of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"156",345,"saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"157",345,"and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"158",345,"looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"159",345,"about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"160",345,"and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"161",345,"fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"162",345,"were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"163",345,"Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"164",345,"hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"165",345,"heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"166",345,"nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"167",345,"had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"168",345,"picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"169",345,"set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"170",345,"however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"171",345,"self-assertion.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"172",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"173",345,"It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"174",345,"very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"175",345,"Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"176",345,"existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"177",345,"of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"178",345,"occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"179",345,"a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"180",345,"proper being assisted by famine and disease.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"181",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"182",345,"Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"183",345,"found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"184",345,"course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"185",345,"evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"186",345,"cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"187",345,"undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"188",345,"fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"189",345,"said, ""The Herr Englishman?"" ""Yes,"" I said, ""Jonathan Harker."" She","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"190",345,"smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"191",345,"who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"192",345,"a letter:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"194",345,"     ""My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"206",345,"_4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"207",345,"directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"208",345,"making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"209",345,"pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"210",345,"true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"211",345,"answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"212",345,"lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"213",345,"way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"214",345,"was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"215",345,"tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"216",345,"and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"217",345,"further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"218",345,"any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"219",345,"comforting.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"220",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"221",345,"Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"222",345,"very hysterical way:","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"223",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"224",345,"""Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?"" She was in such an excited","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"225",345,"state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"226",345,"mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"227",345,"was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"228",345,"that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"229",345,"she asked again:","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"230",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"231",345,"""Do you know what day it is?"" I answered that it was the fourth of May.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"232",345,"She shook her head as she said again:","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"233",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"234",345,"""Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?"" On","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"235",345,"my saying that I did not understand, she went on:","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"236",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"237",345,"""It is the eve of St. George's Day. Do you not know that to-night, when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"238",345,"the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"239",345,"full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"240",345,"She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"241",345,"without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"242",345,"to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"243",345,"ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"244",345,"to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"245",345,"tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"246",345,"her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"247",345,"dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"248",345,"did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"249",345,"taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"250",345,"seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"251",345,"state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"252",345,"rosary round my neck, and said, ""For your mother's sake,"" and went out","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"253",345,"of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"254",345,"for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"255",345,"round my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"256",345,"traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"257",345,"am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"265",345,"hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"266",345,"mixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"267",345,"naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"268",345,"down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"269",345,"left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"270",345,"called ""robber steak""--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"271",345,"pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"272",345,"style of the London cat's meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"273",345,"produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"274",345,"disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"275",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"276",345,"When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"277",345,"talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"278",345,"now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"279",345,"on the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"280",345,"""word-bearer""--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"281",345,"pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"282",345,"there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"283",345,"dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"284",345,"cheering to me, for amongst them were ""Ordog""--Satan, ""pokol""--hell,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"285",345,"""stregoica""--witch, ""vrolok"" and ""vlkoslak""--both of which mean the same","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"286",345,"thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"287",345,"either were-wolf or vampire. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count about these","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"288",345,"superstitions)","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"289",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"290",345,"When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"291",345,"swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"292",345,"pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"293",345,"fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"294",345,"first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"295",345,"charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"296",345,"just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"297",345,"seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"298",345,"could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"299",345,"had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"300",345,"themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"301",345,"rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"302",345,"centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"303",345,"the whole front of the box-seat--""gotza"" they call them--cracked his big","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"304",345,"whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"305",345,"our journey.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"306",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"307",345,"I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"308",345,"scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"309",345,"languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"310",345,"been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"311",345,"land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"312",345,"with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"313",345,"road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"314",345,"plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"315",345,"the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"316",345,"green hills of what they call here the ""Mittel Land"" ran the road,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"317",345,"losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"318",345,"straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"319",345,"hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"320",345,"seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"321",345,"what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"322",345,"time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"323",345,"excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"324",345,"snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"325",345,"the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"326",345,"in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"327",345,"Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"328",345,"and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"329",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"330",345,"Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"331",345,"of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"332",345,"and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"333",345,"them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"334",345,"deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"335",345,"grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"336",345,"pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"337",345,"the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"338",345,"mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"339",345,"the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"340",345,"we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"341",345,"peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"342",345,"be right before us:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"343",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"344",345,"""Look! Isten szek!""--""God's seat!""--and he crossed himself reverently.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"345",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"346",345,"As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"347",345,"us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"348",345,"emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"349",345,"sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"350",345,"we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"351",345,"that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"352",345,"and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"353",345,"was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"354",345,"turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"355",345,"devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"356",345,"many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"357",345,"and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"358",345,"shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"359",345,"again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant's cart--with its","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"360",345,"long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"361",345,"road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"362",345,"peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"363",345,"coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"364",345,"staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"365",345,"and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"366",345,"gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"367",345,"ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"368",345,"Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"369",345,"late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"370",345,"that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"371",345,"greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"372",345,"peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"373",345,"grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"374",345,"threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"375",345,"Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"376",345,"hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"377",345,"only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"378",345,"but the driver would not hear of it. ""No, no,"" he said; ""you must not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"379",345,"walk here; the dogs are too fierce""; and then he added, with what he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"380",345,"evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"381",345,"approving smile of the rest--""and you may have enough of such matters","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"382",345,"before you go to sleep."" The only stop he would make was a moment's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"383",345,"pause to light his lamps.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"384",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"385",345,"When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"386",345,"passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"387",345,"though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"388",345,"with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"389",345,"to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"390",345,"patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"391",345,"hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"392",345,"rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"393",345,"stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"394",345,"to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"395",345,"side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"396",345,"by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"397",345,"upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"398",345,"certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"399",345,"faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"400",345,"fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"401",345,"Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"402",345,"Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"403",345,"passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"404",345,"darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"405",345,"happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"406",345,"give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"407",345,"some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"408",345,"the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"409",345,"air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"410",345,"mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"411",345,"into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"412",345,"which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"413",345,"glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"414",345,"was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"415",345,"hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"416",345,"road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"417",345,"The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"418",345,"my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"419",345,"the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"420",345,"could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"421",345,"thought it was ""An hour less than the time."" Then turning to me, he said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"422",345,"in German worse than my own:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"423",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"424",345,"""There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"425",345,"now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"426",345,"the next day."" Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"427",345,"snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"428",345,"amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"429",345,"of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"430",345,"us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"431",345,"lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"432",345,"splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"433",345,"beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"434",345,"could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"435",345,"in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"436",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"437",345,"""You are early to-night, my friend."" The man stammered in reply:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"438",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"439",345,"""The English Herr was in a hurry,"" to which the stranger replied:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"440",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"441",345,"""That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"442",345,"deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift."" As he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"443",345,"spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"444",345,"very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"445",345,"companions whispered to another the line from Burger's ""Lenore"":--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"446",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"447",345,"    ""Denn die Todten reiten schnell""--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"448",345,"    (""For the dead travel fast."")","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"449",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"450",345,"The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"451",345,"gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"452",345,"putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. ""Give me the Herr's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"453",345,"luggage,"" said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"454",345,"handed out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"455",345,"coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"456",345,"hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"457",345,"prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"458",345,"swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"459",345,"from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"460",345,"against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"461",345,"the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"462",345,"on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"463",345,"strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"464",345,"over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"465",345,"excellent German:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"466",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"467",345,"""The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"468",345,"care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"469",345,"country) underneath the seat, if you should require it."" I did not take","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"470",345,"any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"471",345,"little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"472",345,"any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"473",345,"unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"474",345,"then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"475",345,"seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"476",345,"again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"477",345,"so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"478",345,"I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"479",345,"protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"480",345,"delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"481",345,"passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"482",345,"within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"483",345,"suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"484",345,"recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"485",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"486",345,"Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"487",345,"long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"488",345,"another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"489",345,"now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"490",345,"to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"491",345,"it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"492",345,"strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"493",345,"quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"494",345,"sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"495",345,"side of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"496",345,"affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"497",345,"jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"498",345,"madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"499",345,"from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"500",345,"the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"501",345,"to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"502",345,"whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"503",345,"doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"504",345,"quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"505",345,"took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"506",345,"time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"507",345,"narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"508",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"509",345,"Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"510",345,"roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"511",345,"rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"512",345,"could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"513",345,"rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"514",345,"It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"515",345,"so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"516",345,"keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"517",345,"fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"518",345,"and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"519",345,"grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"520",345,"however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"521",345,"left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"522",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"523",345,"Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"524",345,"driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"525",345,"jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"526",345,"what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"527",345,"I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"528",345,"his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"529",345,"and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"530",345,"endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"531",345,"Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"532",345,"around us I could watch the driver's motions. He went rapidly to where","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"533",345,"the blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"534",345,"to illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"535",345,"formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"536",345,"effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"537",345,"for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"538",345,"as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"539",345,"straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"540",345,"flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"541",345,"wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"542",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"543",345,"At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"544",345,"had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"545",345,"than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"546",345,"for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"547",345,"then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"548",345,"jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"549",345,"around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"550",345,"with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"551",345,"terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"552",345,"For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"553",345,"feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"554",345,"their true import.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"555",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"556",345,"All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"557",345,"some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"558",345,"looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"559",345,"but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"560",345,"had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"561",345,"it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"562",345,"ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"563",345,"calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"564",345,"to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"565",345,"not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"566",345,"looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"567",345,"long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"568",345,"fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"569",345,"the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"570",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"571",345,"When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"572",345,"wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"573",345,"dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"574",345,"seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"575",345,"darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"576",345,"ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"577",345,"always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"578",345,"driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"579",345,"vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"580",345,"and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"581",345,"sky.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"591",345,"_5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"592",345,"awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"593",345,"the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"594",345,"ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"595",345,"it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"596",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"597",345,"When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"598",345,"to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"599",345,"strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"600",345,"crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"601",345,"them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"602",345,"studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"603",345,"massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"604",345,"massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"605",345,"weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"606",345,"reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"607",345,"of the dark openings.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"608",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"609",345,"I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"610",345,"or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"611",345,"window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"612",345,"time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"613",345,"me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"614",345,"What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"615",345,"customary incident in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent out to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"616",345,"explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"617",345,"clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"618",345,"London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"619",345,"full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"620",345,"I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"621",345,"expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"622",345,"the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"623",345,"in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"624",345,"pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"625",345,"and among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"626",345,"wait the coming of the morning.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"627",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"628",345,"Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"629",345,"behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"630",345,"light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"631",345,"massive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"632",345,"of long disuse, and the great door swung back.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"633",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"634",345,"Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"635",345,"moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"636",345,"of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"637",345,"lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"638",345,"throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"639",345,"open door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"640",345,"gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"641",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"642",345,"""Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!"" He made no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"643",345,"motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"644",345,"gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"645",345,"I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"646",345,"holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"647",345,"an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"648",345,"ice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"649",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"650",345,"""Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"651",345,"happiness you bring!"" The strength of the handshake was so much akin to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"652",345,"that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"653",345,"for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"654",345,"speaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"655",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"656",345,"""Count Dracula?"" He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"657",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"658",345,"""I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"659",345,"the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest."" As he was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"660",345,"speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"661",345,"took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"662",345,"protested but he insisted:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"663",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"664",345,"""Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"665",345,"available. Let me see to your comfort myself."" He insisted on carrying","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"666",345,"my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"667",345,"along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"668",345,"heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"669",345,"to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"670",345,"and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"671",345,"flamed and flared.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"672",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"673",345,"The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"674",345,"the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"675",345,"by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"676",345,"through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"677",345,"welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"678",345,"another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"679",345,"fresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"680",345,"left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"681",345,"door:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"682",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"683",345,"""You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"684",345,"toilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"685",345,"into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"686",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"687",345,"The light and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome seemed to have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"688",345,"dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"689",345,"I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"690",345,"toilet, I went into the other room.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"691",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"692",345,"I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"693",345,"great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"694",345,"his hand to the table, and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"695",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"696",345,"""I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"697",345,"me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"698",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"699",345,"I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"700",345,"He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"701",345,"it to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"702",345,"pleasure.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"703",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"704",345,"""I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"705",345,"sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"706",345,"come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"707",345,"whom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"708",345,"and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"709",345,"discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"710",345,"be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"711",345,"your instructions in all matters.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"712",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"713",345,"The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"714",345,"fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"715",345,"and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"716",345,"my supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"717",345,"questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"718",345,"experienced.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"719",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"720",345,"By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host's desire had drawn","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"721",345,"up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"722",345,"at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"723",345,"opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"724",345,"physiognomy.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"725",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"726",345,"His face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"727",345,"thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"728",345,"hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"729",345,"eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"730",345,"hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"731",345,"could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"732",345,"cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"733",345,"the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"734",345,"man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"735",345,"extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"736",345,"though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"737",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"738",345,"Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"739",345,"in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"740",345,"them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"741",345,"coarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"742",345,"the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"743",345,"point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"744",345,"repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"745",345,"horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"746",345,"not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"747",345,"grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"748",345,"protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"749",345,"fireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"750",345,"window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"751",345,"strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"752",345,"down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count's eyes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"753",345,"gleamed, and he said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"754",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"755",345,"""Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"756",345,"Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"757",345,"added:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"758",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"759",345,"""Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"760",345,"hunter."" Then he rose and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"763",345,"shall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"773",345,"_7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"774",345,"last twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"775",345,"own accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"776",345,"supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"777",345,"pot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"778",345,"was written:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"779",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"780",345,"""I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D."" I set to and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"781",345,"enjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"782",345,"might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"783",345,"There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"784",345,"extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"785",345,"is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"786",345,"The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"787",345,"my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"788",345,"been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"789",345,"though in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"790",345,"but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"791",345,"the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"792",345,"table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"793",345,"could either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"794",345,"anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"795",345,"Some time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"796",345,"breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o'clock when I had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"797",345,"it--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"798",345,"the castle until I had asked the Count's permission. There was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"799",345,"absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"800",345,"materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"801",345,"library. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"802",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"803",345,"In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"804",345,"books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"805",345,"newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"806",345,"and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"807",345,"were of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"808",345,"economy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"809",345,"and customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"810",345,"London Directory, the ""Red"" and ""Blue"" books, Whitaker's Almanac, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"811",345,"Army and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"812",345,"Law List.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"813",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"814",345,"Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"815",345,"entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"816",345,"night's rest. Then he went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"817",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"818",345,"""I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"819",345,"will interest you. These companions""--and he laid his hand on some of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"820",345,"the books--""have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"821",345,"since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"822",345,"of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"823",345,"know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"824",345,"your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"825",345,"humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"826",345,"it what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"827",345,"To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"828",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"829",345,"""But, Count,"" I said, ""you know and speak English thoroughly!"" He bowed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"830",345,"gravely.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"831",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"832",345,"""I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"833",345,"fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"834",345,"the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"835",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"836",345,"""Indeed,"" I said, ""you speak excellently.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"837",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"838",345,"""Not so,"" he answered. ""Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"839",345,"London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"840",345,"enough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"841",345,"and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"842",345,"know him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"843",345,"like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"844",345,"speaking if he hear my words, 'Ha, ha! a stranger!' I have been so long","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"845",345,"master that I would be master still--or at least that none other should","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"846",345,"be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"847",345,"Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"848",345,"shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"849",345,"learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"850",345,"error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"851",345,"away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"852",345,"important affairs in hand.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"853",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"854",345,"Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"855",345,"come into that room when I chose. He answered: ""Yes, certainly,"" and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"856",345,"added:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"857",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"858",345,"""You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"859",345,"locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"860",345,"all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"861",345,"my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand."" I said I was sure of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"862",345,"this, and then he went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"863",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"864",345,"""We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"865",345,"not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"866",345,"what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"867",345,"what strange things there may be.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"868",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"869",345,"This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"870",345,"talk, if only for talking's sake, I asked him many questions regarding","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"871",345,"things that had already happened to me or come within my notice.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"872",345,"Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"873",345,"pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"874",345,"frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"875",345,"him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"876",345,"instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"877",345,"flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"878",345,"certain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"879",345,"are supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"880",345,"where treasure has been concealed. ""That treasure has been hidden,"" he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"881",345,"went on, ""in the region through which you came last night, there can be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"882",345,"but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"883",345,"Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"884",345,"in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"885",345,"patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"886",345,"Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"887",345,"to meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"888",345,"their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"889",345,"destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"890",345,"was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"891",345,"sheltered in the friendly soil.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"892",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"893",345,"""But how,"" said I, ""can it have remained so long undiscovered, when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"894",345,"there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"895",345,"The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"896",345,"sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"897",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"898",345,"""Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"899",345,"appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"900",345,"can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"901",345,"would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"902",345,"marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"903",345,"even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"904",345,"find these places again?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"905",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"906",345,"""There you are right,"" I said. ""I know no more than the dead where even","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"907",345,"to look for them."" Then we drifted into other matters.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"908",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"909",345,"""Come,"" he said at last, ""tell me of London and of the house which you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"910",345,"have procured for me."" With an apology for my remissness, I went into my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"911",345,"own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"912",345,"order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"913",345,"passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"914",345,"lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"915",345,"in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"916",345,"reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw's Guide. When I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"917",345,"came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"918",345,"went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"919",345,"everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"920",345,"surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"921",345,"subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"922",345,"more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"923",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"924",345,"""Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"925",345,"I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"926",345,"fall into my country's habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"927",345,"Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"928",345,"in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"929",345,"other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"930",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"931",345,"We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"932",345,"Purfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"933",345,"necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"934",345,"Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"935",345,"place. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"936",345,"inscribe here:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"937",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"938",345,"""At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"939",345,"be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"940",345,"was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"941",345,"built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"942",345,"years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"943",345,"rust.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"944",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"945",345,"""The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"946",345,"Face_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"947",345,"the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"948",345,"the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"949",345,"make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"950",345,"small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"951",345,"flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"952",345,"periods back, I should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stone","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"953",345,"immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"954",345,"iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"955",345,"church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"956",345,"to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"957",345,"various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"958",345,"way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"959",345,"be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"960",345,"large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"961",345,"asylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"962",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"965",345,"""I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"966",345,"live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"967",345,"day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"968",345,"also that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"969",345,"not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"970",345,"gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"971",345,"sparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"972",345,"and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"973",345,"attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"974",345,"shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"975",345,"battlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"976",345,"be alone with my thoughts when I may."" Somehow his words and his look","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"977",345,"did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"978",345,"smile look malignant and saturnine.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"979",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"980",345,"Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"981",345,"together. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"982",345,"the books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"983",345,"England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"984",345,"certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"985",345,"that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"986",345,"estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"987",345,"Yorkshire coast.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"988",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"989",345,"It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. ""Aha!"" he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"990",345,"said; ""still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"991",345,"am informed that your supper is ready."" He took my arm, and we went into","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"992",345,"the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"993",345,"Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"994",345,"home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"995",345,"After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"996",345,"me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"997",345,"after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"998",345,"say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host's wishes in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"999",345,"every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1000",345,"me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1001",345,"the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1002",345,"They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1003",345,"the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1004",345,"tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1005",345,"can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1006",345,"with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1007",345,"Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1009",345,"""Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1010",345,"long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1013",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1014",345,"I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1015",345,"notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1016",345,"warm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1021",345,"_8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1022",345,"diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1023",345,"there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1024",345,"cannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1025",345,"never come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1026",345,"me; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1027",345,"could bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1028",345,"and he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1029",345,"me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1030",345,"imagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1031",345,"at once how I stand--or seem to.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1032",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1033",345,"I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1034",345,"not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1035",345,"and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1036",345,"and heard the Count's voice saying to me, ""Good-morning."" I started, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1037",345,"it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1038",345,"covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1039",345,"but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1040",345,"salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1041",345,"This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1042",345,"could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1043",345,"the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1044",345,"sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1045",345,"the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1046",345,"feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1047",345,"the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1048",345,"trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1049",345,"round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1050",345,"eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1051",345,"my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1052",345,"held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1053",345,"so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1054",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1055",345,"""Take care,"" he said, ""take care how you cut yourself. It is more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1056",345,"dangerous than you think in this country."" Then seizing the shaving","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1057",345,"glass, he went on: ""And this is the wretched thing that has done the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1058",345,"mischief. It is a foul bauble of man's vanity. Away with it!"" and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1059",345,"opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1060",345,"out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1061",345,"of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1062",345,"annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1063",345,"the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1064",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1065",345,"When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1066",345,"not find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1067",345,"as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1068",345,"peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1069",345,"went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1070",345,"view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1071",345,"of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1072",345,"stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1073",345,"touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1074",345,"tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1075",345,"there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1076",345,"the forests.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1077",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1078",345,"But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1079",345,"explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1080",345,"bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1081",345,"an available exit.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1093",345,"When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1094",345,"I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1095",345,"every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1096",345,"helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1097",345,"few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1098",345,"as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1099",345,"that I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1100",345,"anything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1101",345,"am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1102",345,"one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1103",345,"the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1104",345,"himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1105",345,"me if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1106",345,"plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1107",345,"open. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1108",345,"or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1109",345,"shall need, all my brains to get through.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1110",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1111",345,"I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1112",345,"shut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1113",345,"the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1114",345,"the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1115",345,"thought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1116",345,"through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1117",345,"dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1118",345,"menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1119",345,"This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1120",345,"must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1121",345,"brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1122",345,"mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1123",345,"hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1124",345,"coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1125",345,"crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1126",345,"that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1127",345,"comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1128",345,"which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1129",345,"should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1130",345,"is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1131",345,"a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1132",345,"time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1133",345,"mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1134",345,"Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1135",345,"himself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1136",345,"however, not to awake his suspicion.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1140",345,"_Midnight._--I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1141",345,"questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1142",345,"wonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1143",345,"battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1144",345,"afterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1145",345,"and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1146",345,"fate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said ""we,""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1147",345,"and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1148",345,"down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1149",345,"fascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1150",345,"grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1151",345,"white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1152",345,"though he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1153",345,"shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1154",345,"his race:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1155",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1156",345,"""We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1157",345,"of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1158",345,"in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1159",345,"Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1160",345,"Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1161",345,"and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1162",345,"were-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1163",345,"the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1164",345,"till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1165",345,"old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1166",345,"desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1167",345,"Attila, whose blood is in these veins?"" He held up his arms. ""Is it a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1168",345,"wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1169",345,"Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1170",345,"thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1171",345,"Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1172",345,"here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1173",345,"there? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1174",345,"claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1175",345,"was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1176",345,"than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1177",345,"'water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.' Who more gladly than we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1178",345,"throughout the Four Nations received the 'bloody sword,' or at its","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1179",345,"warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1180",345,"redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1181",345,"flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1182",345,"was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1183",345,"the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1184",345,"his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1185",345,"Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1186",345,"indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1187",345,"again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1188",345,"when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1189",345,"to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1190",345,"slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1191",345,"said that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1192",345,"without a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1193",345,"conduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Mohács, we threw off the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1194",345,"Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1195",345,"our spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1196",345,"Szekelys--and the Dracula as their heart's blood, their brains, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1210",345,"books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1211",345,"confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1212",345,"observation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1213",345,"his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1214",345,"doing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1215",345,"books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1216",345,"matters I had been examining at Lincoln's Inn. There was a certain","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1217",345,"method in the Count's inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1218",345,"sequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1219",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1220",345,"First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1221",345,"told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1222",345,"wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1223",345,"one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1224",345,"against his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1225",345,"ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1226",345,"attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1227",345,"local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1228",345,"solicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1229",345,"chance mislead him, so he said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1230",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1231",345,"""I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1232",345,"the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1233",345,"London, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1234",345,"here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1235",345,"sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1236",345,"resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1237",345,"served save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1238",345,"have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1239",345,"seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1240",345,"I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1241",345,"Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1242",345,"ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?"" I answered that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1243",345,"certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1244",345,"agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1245",345,"instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1249",345,"""But,"" said he, ""I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1250",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1251",345,"""Of course,"" I replied; and ""such is often done by men of business, who","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1252",345,"do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1253",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1254",345,"""Good!"" he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1255",345,"consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1256",345,"difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1257",345,"against. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1258",345,"and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1259",345,"wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1260",345,"foresee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1261",345,"evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1262",345,"wonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1263",345,"spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1264",345,"available, he suddenly stood up and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1265",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1266",345,"""Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1267",345,"Hawkins, or to any other?"" It was with some bitterness in my heart that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1268",345,"I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1269",345,"sending letters to anybody.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1270",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1271",345,"""Then write now, my young friend,"" he said, laying a heavy hand on my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1272",345,"shoulder: ""write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1273",345,"please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1274",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1275",345,"""Do you wish me to stay so long?"" I asked, for my heart grew cold at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1276",345,"thought.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1277",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1278",345,"""I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1279",345,"employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1280",345,"it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1281",345,"stinted. Is it not so?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1282",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1283",345,"What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins's interest, not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1284",345,"mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1285",345,"Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1286",345,"which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1287",345,"could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1288",345,"mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1289",345,"in his own smooth, resistless way:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1290",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1291",345,"""I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1292",345,"other than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1293",345,"friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1294",345,"home to them. Is it not so?"" As he spoke he handed me three sheets of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1295",345,"note-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1296",345,"post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1297",345,"with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1298",345,"as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1299",345,"he would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1300",345,"now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1301",345,"to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1302",345,"did see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1303",345,"book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1304",345,"some books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1305",345,"own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1306",345,"had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1307",345,"were face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1308",345,"under the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1309",345,"I could.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1310",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1311",345,"One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1312",345,"Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1313",345,"Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1314",345,"bankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1315",345,"about to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1316",345,"seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1317",345,"to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1318",345,"hand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1319",345,"them carefully, and then turning to me, said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1320",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1321",345,"""I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1322",345,"evening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish."" At the door he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1323",345,"turned, and after a moment's pause said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1324",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1325",345,"""Let me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1326",345,"seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1327",345,"chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1328",345,"many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1329",345,"warned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1330",345,"haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1331",345,"safe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then""--He finished his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1332",345,"speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1333",345,"washing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1334",345,"dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1335",345,"and mystery which seemed closing around me.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1336",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1337",345,"       *       *       *       *       *","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1338",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1339",345,"_Later._--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1340",345,"doubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1341",345,"not. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--I imagine that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1342",345,"my rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1343",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1344",345,"When he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1345",345,"sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1346",345,"towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1347",345,"inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1348",345,"of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1349",345,"prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1350",345,"the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1351",345,"It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1352",345,"sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1353",345,"terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1354",345,"expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1355",345,"day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1356",345,"in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1357",345,"to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1358",345,"leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1359",345,"below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1360",345,"the rooms, that the windows of the Count's own room would look out. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1361",345,"window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1362",345,"weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1363",345,"the case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1364",345,"carefully out.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1365",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1366",345,"What I saw was the Count's head coming out from the window. I did not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1367",345,"see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1368",345,"back and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1369",345,"so many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1370",345,"somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1371",345,"and amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1372",345,"repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1373",345,"window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1374",345,"_face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1375",345,"first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1376",345,"moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1377",345,"be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1378",345,"stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1379",345,"using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1380",345,"speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1381",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1382",345,"What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1383",345,"semblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1384",345,"me; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I am","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1385",345,"encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1386",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1387",345,"       *       *       *       *       *","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1388",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1389",345,"_15 May._--Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1390",345,"He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1391",345,"deal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1392",345,"had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1393",345,"avail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1394",345,"knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1395",345,"explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1396",345,"taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1397",345,"expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1398",345,"stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1399",345,"pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1400",345,"door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1401",345,"room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1402",345,"escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1403",345,"and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1404",345,"small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1405",345,"them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1406",345,"however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1407",345,"seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1408",345,"and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1409",345,"from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1410",345,"rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1411",345,"again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1412",345,"I could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1413",345,"than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1414",345,"see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1415",345,"windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1416",345,"side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1417",345,"was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1418",345,"quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1419",345,"bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1420",345,"impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1421",345,"west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1422",345,"mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1423",345,"mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1424",345,"crannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1425",345,"occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1426",345,"comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1427",345,"yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1428",345,"see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1429",345,"all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1430",345,"lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1431",345,"glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1432",345,"which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1433",345,"than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1434",345,"presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1435",345,"found a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1436",345,"table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1437",345,"thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1438",345,"diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1439",345,"nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1440",345,"senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1441",345,"which mere ""modernity"" cannot kill.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1442",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1443",345,"       *       *       *       *       *","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1444",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1445",345,"_Later: the Morning of 16 May._--God preserve my sanity, for to this I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1446",345,"am reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1447",345,"Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1448",345,"go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1449",345,"is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1450",345,"hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1451",345,"can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1452",345,"purpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1453",345,"lies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1454",345,"have puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1455",345,"when he made Hamlet say:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1456",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1457",345,"    ""My tablets! quick, my tablets!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1458",345,"    'Tis meet that I put it down,"" etc.,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1459",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1460",345,"for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1461",345,"had come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1462",345,"The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1463",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1464",345,"The Count's mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1465",345,"me more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1466",345,"me. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1467",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1468",345,"When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1469",345,"pen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count's warning came into my mind,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1470",345,"but I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1471",345,"and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1472",345,"moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1473",345,"which refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1474",345,"gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1475",345,"and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1476",345,"their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1477",345,"couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1478",345,"at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1479",345,"the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1480",345,"asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1481",345,"real--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1482",345,"morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1483",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1484",345,"I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1485",345,"came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1486",345,"my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1487",345,"dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1488",345,"their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1489",345,"when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1490",345,"no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1491",345,"time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1492",345,"noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1493",345,"almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1494",345,"fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1495",345,"like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1496",345,"in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1497",345,"moment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1498",345,"pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1499",345,"about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1500",345,"deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1501",345,"kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1502",345,"day it should meet Mina's eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1503",345,"They whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1504",345,"silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1505",345,"come through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1506",345,"tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1507",345,"The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1508",345,"on. One said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1509",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1510",345,"""Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1511",345,"begin."" The other added:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1512",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1513",345,"""He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all."" I lay quiet,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1514",345,"looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1515",345,"The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1516",345,"of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1517",345,"the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1518",345,"underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1519",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1520",345,"I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1521",345,"the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1522",345,"gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1523",345,"and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1524",345,"like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1525",345,"on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1526",345,"teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1527",345,"my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1528",345,"paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1529",345,"her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1530",345,"skin of my throat began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1531",345,"is to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. I could feel the soft,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1532",345,"shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1533",345,"and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1534",345,"I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1535",345,"heart.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1536",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1537",345,"But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1538",345,"lightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1539",345,"being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1540",345,"saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1541",345,"giant's power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1542",345,"white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1543",345,"passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1544",345,"the demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1545",345,"in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1546",345,"face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1547",345,"the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1548",345,"of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1549",345,"from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1550",345,"them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1551",345,"wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1552",345,"cut through the air and then ring round the room he said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1553",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1554",345,"""How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1555",345,"I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1556",345,"how you meddle with him, or you'll have to deal with me."" The fair girl,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1557",345,"with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1558",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1559",345,"""You yourself never loved; you never love!"" On this the other women","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1560",345,"joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1561",345,"room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1562",345,"of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1563",345,"and said in a soft whisper:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1564",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1565",345,"""Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1566",345,"not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1567",345,"kiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1568",345,"to be done.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1569",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1570",345,"""Are we to have nothing to-night?"" said one of them, with a low laugh,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1571",345,"as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1572",345,"moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1573",345,"nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1574",345,"ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1575",345,"half-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1576",345,"horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1577",345,"bag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1578",345,"without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1579",345,"moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1580",345,"dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1581",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1592",345,"I awoke in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1593",345,"have carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1594",345,"could not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1595",345,"certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1596",345,"in a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1597",345,"rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1598",345,"many such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1599",345,"evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1600",345,"another, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1601",345,"thing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1602",345,"me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1603",345,"am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1604",345,"have brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look round this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1605",345,"room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1606",345,"sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1607",345,"were--who _are_--waiting to suck my blood.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1611",345,"_18 May._--I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1612",345,"I _must_ know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1613",345,"stairs I found it closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1614",345,"jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1615",345,"of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1620",345,"_19 May._--I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1621",345,"the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1622",345,"was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1623",345,"another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1624",345,"letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1625",345,"Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1626",345,"of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1627",345,"am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1628",345,"suspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1629",345,"that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1630",345,"prolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1631",345,"chance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1632",345,"which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1633",345,"to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1634",345,"ensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1635",345,"impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1636",345,"be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1637",345,"prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1638",345,"suspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1639",345,"him what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1640",345,"then said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1641",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1642",345,"""The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1649",345,"_28 May._--There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1650",345,"send word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1651",345,"encamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1652",345,"them in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, though","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1653",345,"allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1654",345,"of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1655",345,"They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or _boyar_, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1656",345,"call themselves by his name. They are fearless and without religion,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1660",345,"I shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1661",345,"posted. I have already spoken them through my window to begin","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1662",345,"acquaintanceship. They took their hats off and made obeisance and many","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1680",345,"in his cap. I could do no more. I stole back to the study, and began to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1681",345,"read. As the Count did not come in, I have written here....","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1690",345,"it--""one is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other""--here","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1691",345,"he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1692",345,"the dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly--""the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1693",345,"other is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1694",345,"not signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us."" And he calmly held letter","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1695",345,"and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1696",345,"went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1698",345,"""The letter to Hawkins--that I shall, of course, send on, since it is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1700",345,"unknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?"" He held","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1701",345,"out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1702",345,"envelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1703",345,"he went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute later","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1704",345,"I went over and tried it, and the door was locked.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1706",345,"When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1707",345,"coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1713",345,"to me; but you will sleep, I pray."" I passed to my room and went to bed,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1735",345,"_17 June._--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1736",345,"cudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1737",345,"and scraping of horses' feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1738",345,"With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1739",345,"leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1740",345,"each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1741",345,"sheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1742",345,"ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1743",345,"main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1744",345,"shock: my door was fastened on the outside.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1745",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1746",345,"Then I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1747",345,"stupidly and pointed, but just then the ""hetman"" of the Szgany came out,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1748",345,"and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1749",345,"laughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1750",345,"entreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1751",345,"The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1752",345,"rope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1753",345,"handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1754",345,"they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1755",345,"yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1756",345,"it for luck, lazily went each to his horse's head. Shortly afterwards, I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1757",345,"heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1761",345,"_24 June, before morning._--Last night the Count left me early, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1762",345,"locked himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1763",345,"winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1764",345,"thought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1765",345,"The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1766",345,"some kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1767",345,"as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1768",345,"ruthless villainy.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1769",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1770",345,"I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1771",345,"something coming out of the Count's window. I drew back and watched","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1772",345,"carefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1773",345,"find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1774",345,"travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1775",345,"had seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1776",345,"and in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he will","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1777",345,"allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1778",345,"evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1779",345,"letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1780",345,"people be attributed to me.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1781",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1782",345,"It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1783",345,"here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1784",345,"is even a criminal's right and consolation.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1785",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1786",345,"I thought I would watch for the Count's return, and for a long time sat","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1787",345,"doggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1788",345,"quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1789",345,"like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1790",345,"clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1791",345,"soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1792",345,"embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1793",345,"fully the aërial gambolling.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1794",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1795",345,"Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1796",345,"below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1797",345,"ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1798",345,"the sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1799",345,"awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1800",345,"and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1801",345,"was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1802",345,"moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1803",345,"beyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1804",345,"shapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1805",345,"senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1806",345,"becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1807",345,"three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1808",345,"safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1809",345,"was burning brightly.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1810",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1811",345,"When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1812",345,"Count's room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1813",345,"there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1814",345,"beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1815",345,"could do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1816",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1817",345,"As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1818",345,"woman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1819",345,"the bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1820",345,"hands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1821",345,"against a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1822",345,"threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1823",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1824",345,"""Monster, give me my child!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1825",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1826",345,"She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1827",345,"words in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1828",345,"breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1829",345,"emotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1830",345,"her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1831",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1832",345,"Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1833",345,"Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1834",345,"answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1835",345,"had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1836",345,"through the wide entrance into the courtyard.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1837",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1838",345,"There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1839",345,"short. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1840",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1841",345,"I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1842",345,"she was better dead.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1843",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1844",345,"What shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1845",345,"thing of night and gloom and fear?","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1849",345,"_25 June, morning._--No man knows till he has suffered from the night","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1850",345,"how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. When the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1851",345,"sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1852",345,"gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1853",345,"as if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1854",345,"if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1855",345,"take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Last","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1856",345,"night one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1857",345,"series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1858",345,"earth.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1859",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1860",345,"Let me not think of it. Action!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1861",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1862",345,"It has always been at night-time that I have been molested or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1863",345,"threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1864",345,"Count in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1865",345,"he may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his room!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1866",345,"But there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1867",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1868",345,"Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1869",345,"why may not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl from his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1870",345,"window. Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1871",345,"chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. I shall risk","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1872",345,"it. At the worst it can only be death; and a man's death is not a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1873",345,"calf's, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1874",345,"in my task! Good-bye, Mina, if I fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1875",345,"second father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1879",345,"_Same day, later._--I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1880",345,"come safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1881",345,"went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1882",345,"side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1883",345,"around the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1884",345,"and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1885",345,"took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1886",345,"once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1887",345,"not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1888",345,"well the direction and distance of the Count's window, and made for it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1889",345,"as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1890",345,"not feel dizzy--I suppose I was too excited--and the time seemed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1891",345,"ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1892",345,"trying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1893",345,"I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1894",345,"around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1895",345,"The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1896",345,"seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1897",345,"style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1898",345,"for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1899",345,"anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1900",345,"corner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1901",345,"Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1902",345,"though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1903",345,"less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1904",345,"some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1905",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1906",345,"At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1907",345,"could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1908",345,"was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1909",345,"all my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1910",345,"passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1911",345,"minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1912",345,"by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1913",345,"tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1914",345,"odour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1915",345,"grew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1916",345,"ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1917",345,"been used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1918",345,"steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1919",345,"the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1920",345,"brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1921",345,"any further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1922",345,"the ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1923",345,"vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1924",345,"my very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1925",345,"of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1926",345,"discovery.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1927",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1928",345,"There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1929",345,"pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep, I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1930",345,"could not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1931",345,"glassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1932",345,"their pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1933",345,"movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1934",345,"and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1935",345,"there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1936",345,"By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1937",345,"I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1938",345,"the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1939",345,"though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1940",345,"leaving the Count's room by the window, crawled again up the castle","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1941",345,"wall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1942",345,"to think....","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1943",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1946",345,"_29 June._--To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1947",345,"taken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1948",345,"castle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1949",345,"lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1950",345,"destroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man's hand would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1951",345,"have any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1952",345,"to see those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1953",345,"till I fell asleep.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1954",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1955",345,"I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"1997",345,"orchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor. After a pause","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1998",345,"of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"1999",345,"the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2000",345,"open.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2001",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2002",345,"To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2004",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2005",345,"As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2006",345,"and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2007",345,"feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2008",345,"to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2009",345,"allies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2010",345,"continued slowly to open, and only the Count's body stood in the gap.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2011",345,"Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2012",345,"doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2013",345,"was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2014",345,"as a last chance I cried out:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2015",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2016",345,"""Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!"" and covered my face with my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2017",345,"hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2018",345,"powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2019",345,"and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2020",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2021",345,"In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2022",345,"to my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2023",345,"to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2024",345,"Judas in hell might be proud of.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2025",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2026",345,"When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2027",345,"whispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2028",345,"deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2029",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2030",345,"""Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2031",345,"patience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!"" There was a low,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2032",345,"sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2033",345,"without the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2034",345,"all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2035",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2036",345,"I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2037",345,"the end? To-morrow! to-morrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2038",345,"dear!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2042",345,"_30 June, morning._--These may be the last words I ever write in this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2043",345,"diary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2044",345,"on my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2045",345,"ready.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2046",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2047",345,"At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2048",345,"had come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2049",345,"With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seen","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2050",345,"that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2051",345,"that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2052",345,"massive bolts.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2053",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2054",345,"But the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2055",345,"the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2056",345,"casement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2057",345,"Count.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2058",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2059",345,"Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2060",345,"determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2061",345,"room. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2062",345,"evils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2063",345,"down the wall, as before, into the Count's room. It was empty, but that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2064",345,"was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2065",345,"remained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2066",345,"stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2067",345,"enough where to find the monster I sought.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2068",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2069",345,"The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2070",345,"was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2071",345,"places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2072",345,"I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2073",345,"something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2074",345,"but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2075",345,"and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2076",345,"and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2077",345,"ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2078",345,"corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2079",345,"burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2080",345,"underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2081",345,"simply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2082",345,"repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2083",345,"me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2084",345,"coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2085",345,"horrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2086",345,"key. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2087",345,"on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2088",345,"was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2089",345,"he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2090",345,"create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2091",345,"helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2092",345,"to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2093",345,"but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2094",345,"cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2095",345,"hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2096",345,"upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2097",345,"paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2098",345,"merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2099",345,"hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2100",345,"caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2101",345,"thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2102",345,"blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2103",345,"own in the nethermost hell.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2104",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2105",345,"I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2106",345,"on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2107",345,"waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2108",345,"closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2109",345,"cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2110",345,"spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2111",345,"contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2112",345,"room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2113",345,"With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2114",345,"key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2115",345,"have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2116",345,"the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2117",345,"dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2118",345,"run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2119",345,"but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2120",345,"door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2121",345,"the lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2122",345,"hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2123",345,"round me more closely.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2124",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2125",345,"As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2126",345,"and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2127",345,"with their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2128",345,"box being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2129",345,"along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2130",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2131",345,"The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2132",345,"in the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2133",345,"shuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2134",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2135",345,"Hark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2225",345,"I ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2228",345,"read one's thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2278",345,"will tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2279",345,"Arthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything--don't you think","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2280",345,"so, dear?--and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2281",345,"be quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2282",345,"quite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2283",345,"before lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2284",345,"man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2285",345,"outwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2286",345,"himself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2287",345,"almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don't generally do","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2288",345,"when they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2289",345,"playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2290",345,"me, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2291",345,"though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2292",345,"help and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2293",345,"did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2294",345,"and would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2295",345,"I could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2296",345,"and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2297",345,"else. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2298",345,"confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman's heart was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2299",345,"free a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2300",345,"tell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2301",345,"stood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2302",345,"hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2303",345,"wanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can't","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2304",345,"help crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2305",345,"proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn't at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2316",345,"came after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2317",345,"he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2318",345,"has been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2319",345,"with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2322",345,"what I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2323",345,"don't, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2324",345,"told any, and yet---- My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2325",345,"Morris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2326",345,"alone. No, he doesn't, for Arthur tried twice to _make_ a chance, and I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2327",345,"helping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2328",345,"beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn't always speak slang--that is to say,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2329",345,"he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2330",345,"educated and has exquisite manners--but he found out that it amused me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2331",345,"to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2332",345,"was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2333",345,"dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2334",345,"has to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2335",345,"ever speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2336",345,"heard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2337",345,"as happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2338",345,"very nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2339",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2340",345,"""'Miss Lucy, I know I ain't good enough to regulate the fixin's of your","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2342",345,"will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won't","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2344",345,"together, driving in double harness?'","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2345",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2346",345,"""Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn't seem","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2347",345,"half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2348",345,"lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2349",345,"wasn't broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2350",345,"a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2351",345,"on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2352",345,"really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn't help","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2353",345,"feeling a bit serious too--I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2354",345,"flirt--though I couldn't help feeling a sort of exultation that he was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2355",345,"number two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2356",345,"began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2357",345,"heart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2358",345,"never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2359",345,"because he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2360",345,"which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2373",345,"this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one--and I really felt very","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2374",345,"badly. Why can't they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2375",345,"her, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2376",345,"it. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2377",345,"Mr. Morris's brave eyes, and I told him out straight:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2378",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2379",345,"""'Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2380",345,"even loves me.' I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2381",345,"light came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine--I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2382",345,"think I put them into his--and said in a hearty way:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2383",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2384",345,"""'That's my brave girl. It's better worth being late for a chance of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2385",345,"winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don't","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2386",345,"cry, my dear. If it's for me, I'm a hard nut to crack; and I take it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2387",345,"standing up. If that other fellow doesn't know his happiness, well, he'd","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2388",345,"better look for it soon, or he'll have to deal with me. Little girl,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2389",345,"your honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that's rarer than a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2390",345,"lover; it's more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I'm going to have a pretty","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2391",345,"lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won't you give me one kiss?","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2392",345,"It'll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2393",345,"know, if you like, for that other good fellow--he must be a good fellow,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2394",345,"my dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him--hasn't spoken","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2395",345,"yet.' That quite won me, Mina, for it _was_ brave and sweet of him, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2396",345,"noble, too, to a rival--wasn't it?--and he so sad; so I leant over and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2397",345,"kissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2398",345,"into my face--I am afraid I was blushing very much--he said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2399",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2400",345,"""'Little girl, I hold your hand, and you've kissed me, and if these","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2401",345,"things don't make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2402",345,"honesty to me, and good-bye.' He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2505",345,"_24 July. Whitby._--Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2506",345,"lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2507",345,"which they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2508",345,"Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2509",345,"harbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2510",345,"view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2511",345,"beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2512",345,"on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2513",345,"see down. The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2514",345,"red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2515",345,"pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2516",345,"Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2517",345,"""Marmion,"" where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2518",345,"ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2519",345,"a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2520",345,"the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2521",345,"graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2522",345,"Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2523",345,"harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2524",345,"stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2525",345,"part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2526",345,"destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2527",345,"out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2528",345,"them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2529",345,"looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2530",345,"sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2531",345,"book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2532",345,"sitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2533",345,"talk.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2534",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2535",345,"The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2536",345,"stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2537",345,"the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2538",345,"of it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2539",345,"and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2540",345,"narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2541",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2542",345,"It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2543",345,"nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2544",345,"banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2545",345,"side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2546",345,"which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2547",345,"it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2548",345,"mournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2549",345,"lost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2550",345,"is coming this way....","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2551",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2552",345,"He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2553",345,"gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2554",345,"nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2555",345,"fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2556",345,"person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2557",345,"at the abbey he said very brusquely:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2558",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2559",345,"""I wouldn't fash masel' about them, miss. Them things be all wore out.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2560",345,"Mind, I don't say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn't in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2561",345,"my time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an' the like,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2562",345,"but not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2564",345,"out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel' who'd be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2565",345,"bothered tellin' lies to them--even the newspapers, which is full of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2566",345,"fool-talk."" I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2567",345,"things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2568",345,"the whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2569",345,"when the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2570",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2571",345,"""I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn't like","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2572",345,"to be kept waitin' when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2573",345,"crammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of 'em; an', miss, I lack","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2574",345,"belly-timber sairly by the clock.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2575",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2576",345,"He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2577",345,"the steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2578",345,"the town up to the church, there are hundreds of them--I do not know how","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2579",345,"many--and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2580",345,"a horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originally","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2581",345,"have had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy went","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2582",345,"out visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2583",345,"not go. They will be home by this.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2587",345,"_1 August._--I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2588",345,"interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2589",345,"and join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2590",345,"must have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2591",345,"anything, and downfaces everybody. If he can't out-argue them he bullies","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2592",345,"them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2593",345,"was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2594",345,"beautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men did","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2595",345,"not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2596",345,"She is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love with her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2597",345,"on the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2598",345,"gave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2599",345,"and he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try to remember it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2600",345,"and put it down:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2601",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2779",345,"was very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2780",345,"gave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2781",345,"watch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2814",345,"should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2815",345,"I said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2862",345,"(life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2901",345,"yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2902",345,"him. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2903",345,"had just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2904",345,"and says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2905",345,"I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2906",345,"although she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2907",345,"her sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2908",345,"that I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. Westenra has","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2910",345,"along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2911",345,"with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2945",345,"surely would have written. I look at that last letter of his, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2946",345,"somehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2947",345,"his writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2949",345,"which I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2955",345,"feel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2956",345,"letter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2957",345,"than ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2958",345,"the fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2959",345,"learn the weather signs. To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2960",345,"hidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey--except","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2961",345,"the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2962",345,"grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2963",345,"grey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2964",345,"is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2965",345,"muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2966",345,"mist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2967",345,"there is a ""brool"" over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2968",345,"Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2969",345,"the mist, and seem ""men like trees walking."" The fishing-boats are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2970",345,"racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2971",345,"the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2972",345,"making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2973",345,"he wants to talk....","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2974",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2975",345,"I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he sat","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2976",345,"down beside me, he said in a very gentle way:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2977",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2978",345,"""I want to say something to you, miss."" I could see he was not at ease,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2979",345,"so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2980",345,"fully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2981",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2982",345,"""I'm afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2983",345,"things I've been sayin' about the dead, and such like, for weeks past;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2984",345,"but I didn't mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I'm gone. We","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2985",345,"aud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don't","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"2987",345,"an' that's why I've took to makin' light of it, so that I'd cheer up my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2988",345,"own heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain't afraid of dyin', not a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"2989",345,"bit; only I don't want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3001",345,"it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!"" he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3002",345,"cried suddenly. ""There's something in that wind and in the hoast beyont","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3003",345,"that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It's in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3004",345,"air; I feel it comin'. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3005",345,"comes!"" He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3006",345,"moved as though he were praying. After a few minutes' silence, he got","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3007",345,"up, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3016",345,"a bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can't decide whether to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3036",345,"One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3037",345,"experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3038",345,"been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3039",345,"August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3040",345,"body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3041",345,"Robin Hood's Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3042",345,"the neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers _Emma_ and _Scarborough_ made","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3043",345,"trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3044",345,"""tripping"" both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3045",345,"afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3046",345,"churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3047",345,"sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3048",345,"""mares'-tails"" high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3049",345,"blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3050",345,"language is ranked ""No. 2: light breeze."" The coastguard on duty at once","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3051",345,"made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3052",345,"kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3053",345,"manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3054",345,"beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3055",345,"there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3056",345,"churchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3057",345,"mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3058",345,"downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3059",345,"purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3060",345,"there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3061",345,"sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3062",345,"experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3063",345,"sketches of the ""Prelude to the Great Storm"" will grace the R. A. and R.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3064",345,"I. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3065",345,"there that his ""cobble"" or his ""mule,"" as they term the different","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3066",345,"classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3067",345,"The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3068",345,"was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3069",345,"the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3070",345,"were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3071",345,"which usually ""hug"" the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3072",345,"few fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3073",345,"schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3074",345,"foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3075",345,"comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3076",345,"her to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3077",345,"was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3078",345,"swell of the sea,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3079",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3080",345,"    ""As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3081",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3082",345,"Shortly before ten o'clock the stillness of the air grew quite","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3083",345,"oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3084",345,"inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3085",345,"band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3086",345,"great harmony of nature's silence. A little after midnight came a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3087",345,"strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3088",345,"carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3089",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3090",345,"Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3091",345,"time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3092",345,"the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3093",345,"growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3094",345,"the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3095",345,"White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3096",345,"shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3097",345,"the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3098",345,"of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3099",345,"force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3100",345,"or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3101",345,"to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3102",345,"fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3103",345,"the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3104",345,"drifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3105",345,"so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3106",345,"imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3107",345,"touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3108",345,"a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3109",345,"cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3110",345,"lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3111",345,"of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3112",345,"of the footsteps of the storm.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3113",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3114",345,"Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3115",345,"absorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3116",345,"each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3117",345,"snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3118",345,"a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3119",345,"the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3120",345,"Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3121",345,"tried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3122",345,"the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3123",345,"Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3124",345,"with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3125",345,"of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3126",345,"piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3127",345,"joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3128",345,"to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3129",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3130",345,"Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3131",345,"with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3132",345,"earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3133",345,"and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3134",345,"realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3135",345,"port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3136",345,"to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3137",345,"it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3138",345,"harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3139",345,"great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3140",345,"visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3141",345,"speed that, in the words of one old salt, ""she must fetch up somewhere,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3142",345,"if it was only in hell."" Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3143",345,"any hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3144",345,"like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3145",345,"for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3146",345,"booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3147",345,"than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3148",345,"mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3149",345,"breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3150",345,"of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3151",345,"the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3152",345,"swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3153",345,"gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3154",345,"shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3155",345,"corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3156",345,"motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3157",345,"awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3158",345,"found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3159",345,"all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3160",345,"schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3161",345,"that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3162",345,"storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3163",345,"Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3164",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3165",345,"There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3166",345,"the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3167",345,"""top-hammer"" came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3168",345,"the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3169",345,"if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3170",345,"on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3171",345,"hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3178",345,"all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3179",345,"out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3180",345,"side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3181",345,"first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3182",345,"the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3183",345,"light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3184",345,"when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3185",345,"once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3186",345,"curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3187",345,"round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3188",345,"correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3189",345,"When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3190",345,"whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3191",345,"courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3192",345,"to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3193",345,"whilst actually lashed to the wheel.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3194",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3195",345,"It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3196",345,"not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3197",345,"by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3198",345,"the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3199",345,"was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3200",345,"the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3201",345,"the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3202",345,"the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3203",345,"was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3204",345,"state of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3205",345,"Place--who came immediately after me, declared, after making","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3206",345,"examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3207",345,"pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3208",345,"paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3209",345,"the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3210",345,"teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3211",345,"complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3231",345,"_9 August._--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3232",345,"storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3233",345,"turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3234",345,"_Demeter_. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3235",345,"small amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3236",345,"This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3237",345,"7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3238",345,"possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3239",345,"acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3240",345,"paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3241",345,"the strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3242",345,"most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3243",345,"existing regulations. As the matter is to be a ""nine days' wonder,"" they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3244",345,"are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3245",345,"complaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3246",345,"landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3247",345,"S. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3248",345,"animal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3249",345,"it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3250",345,"was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3251",345,"hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3252",345,"possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3253",345,"is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3254",345,"mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3255",345,"dead in the roadway opposite to its master's yard. It had been fighting,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3415",345,"_3 August_.--At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3416",345,"when I got to it found no one there. The wind was steady, and as we ran","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3417",345,"before it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3418",345,"mate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3419",345,"looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3420",345,"way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3421",345,"ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: ""_It_ is here; I know","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3422",345,"it, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3423",345,"and ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3424",345,"It, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3425",345,"air."" And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3426",345,"space. Then he went on: ""But It is here, and I'll find It. It is in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3427",345,"hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I'll unscrew them one by one and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3428",345,"see. You work the helm."" And, with a warning look and his finger on his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3429",345,"lip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3430",345,"not leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3431",345,"and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3432",345,"raving mad, and it's no use my trying to stop him. He can't hurt those","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3433",345,"big boxes: they are invoiced as ""clay,"" and to pull them about is as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3434",345,"harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3444",345,"startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3445",345,"came as if shot from a gun--a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3446",345,"his face convulsed with fear. ""Save me! save me!"" he cried, and then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3447",345,"looked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3448",345,"a steady voice he said: ""You had better come too, captain, before it is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3449",345,"too late. _He_ is there. I know the secret now. The sea will save me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3450",345,"from Him, and it is all that is left!"" Before I could say a word, or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3451",345,"move forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3452",345,"threw himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3453",345,"this madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3454",345,"followed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all these","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3500",345,"twice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3503",345,"thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3521",345,"was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3522",345,"churchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3523",345,"the cortège of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3524",345,"again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3525",345,"The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3526",345,"it when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3527",345,"She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3528",345,"her dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing:","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3529",345,"she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3530",345,"there be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3531",345,"cause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3532",345,"seat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3533",345,"fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3534",345,"fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3535",345,"dear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3536",345,"sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3537",345,"people do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3538",345,"not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3539",345,"who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3540",345,"The dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3541",345,"the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3542",345,"not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3543",345,"yards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3544",345,"harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3545",345,"noise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3546",345,"bristling out like a cat's tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3547",345,"the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3548",345,"took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3549",345,"the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3550",345,"stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3551",345,"not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3552",345,"in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3553",345,"to comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3554",345,"touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3555",345,"fear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3556",345,"without trouble. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3576",345,"walk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3577",345,"dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3578",345,"and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3579",345,"except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3580",345,"and give us a fresh start. We had a capital ""severe tea"" at Robin Hood's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3581",345,"Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3582",345,"the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3583",345,"shocked the ""New Woman"" with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3584",345,"them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3585",345,"and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3586",345,"really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3587",345,"The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3588",345,"for supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3589",345,"know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3590",345,"some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3591",345,"class of curates, who don't take supper, no matter how they may be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3592",345,"pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3593",345,"breathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3594",345,"looks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3595",345,"only in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3596",345,"Some of the ""New Women"" writers will some day start an idea that men and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3610",345,"Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3611",345,"upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3612",345,"so I could not see Lucy's bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3613",345,"was empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3614",345,"door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3615",345,"mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3616",345,"clothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3617",345,"struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3618",345,"dreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3619",345,"Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. ""Thank God,"" I said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3620",345,"to myself, ""she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress."" I ran","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3621",345,"downstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3622",345,"all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3623",345,"chilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3624",345,"was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3625",345,"of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3626",345,"Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3627",345,"might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3628",345,"big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3629",345,"Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3630",345,"Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3631",345,"the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3632",345,"the East Cliff, in the hope or fear--I don't know which--of seeing Lucy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3633",345,"in our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3634",345,"driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3635",345,"light and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3636",345,"nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary's Church and all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3637",345,"around it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3638",345,"coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3639",345,"a sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3640",345,"visible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3641",345,"there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3642",345,"half-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3643",345,"quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3644",345,"immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3645",345,"the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3646",345,"whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3647",345,"glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3648",345,"fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3649",345,"Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3650",345,"that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy's condition. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3651",345,"time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3652",345,"came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3653",345,"gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3654",345,"lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3655",345,"to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3656",345,"close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3657",345,"was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3658",345,"half-reclining white figure. I called in fright, ""Lucy! Lucy!"" and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3659",345,"something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3660",345,"and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3661",345,"entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3662",345,"the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3663",345,"view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3664",345,"that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3665",345,"of the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3666",345,"thing about.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3667",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3668",345,"When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3669",345,"were parted, and she was breathing--not softly as usual with her, but in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3670",345,"long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3671",345,"breath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3672",345,"collar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3673",345,"there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3674",345,"flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3675",345,"for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3676",345,"unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3677",345,"have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3678",345,"throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3679",345,"and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3680",345,"became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3681",345,"had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3682",345,"very gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3683",345,"became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3684",345,"occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3685",345,"reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3686",345,"till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3687",345,"to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3688",345,"Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3689",345,"have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3690",345,"unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3691",345,"trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3692",345,"me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3693",345,"passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3694",345,"stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3695",345,"However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3696",345,"was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3697",345,"mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3698",345,"one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3699",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3700",345,"Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3701",345,"a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3702",345,"us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3703",345,"there are here, steep little closes, or ""wynds,"" as they call them in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3704",345,"Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3705",345,"should faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3706",345,"health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3707",345,"in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3708",345,"feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3709",345,"bed. Before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3710",345,"word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3711",345,"hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3712",345,"mother's health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3713",345,"and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted--nay,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3714",345,"infallibly would--in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3715",345,"so. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3716",345,"my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3717",345,"soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3723",345,"seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3724",345,"looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3725",345,"notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it might","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3726",345,"have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3727",345,"pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3728",345,"two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3729",345,"was a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3730",345,"laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3737",345,"Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3739",345,"I could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3740",345,"Jonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the evening","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3741",345,"we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3742",345,"and Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3743",345,"has been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3750",345,"was wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3751",345,"be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3752",345,"under a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3753",345,"chirping outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3754",345,"was even better than on the previous morning. All her old gaiety of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3755",345,"manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3756",345,"and told me all about Arthur. I told her how anxious I was about","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3757",345,"Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3764",345,"before. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3765",345,"still asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3766",345,"aside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3767",345,"effect of the light over the sea and sky--merged together in one great,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3768",345,"silent mystery--was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlight","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3769",345,"flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3770",345,"twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3771",345,"and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came back","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3772",345,"from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3773",345,"She did not stir again all night.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3777",345,"_14 August._--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seems","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3778",345,"to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3779",345,"get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3780",345,"dinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3781",345,"dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3782",345,"stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3783",345,"down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3784",345,"thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3785",345,"everything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3786",345,"suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3787",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3788",345,"""His red eyes again! They are just the same."" It was such an odd","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3789",345,"expression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3790",345,"slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3791",345,"at her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3792",345,"her face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3793",345,"followed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3794",345,"whereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3795",345,"for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3796",345,"burning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3797",345,"sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary's Church behind our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3798",345,"seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3799",345,"refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3800",345,"called Lucy's attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3801",345,"with a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3802",345,"was thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3803",345,"said nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3804",345,"early to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3805",345,"I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3806",345,"sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home--it was then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3807",345,"bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3808",345,"Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen--I threw a glance","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3809",345,"up at our window, and saw Lucy's head leaning out. I thought that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3810",345,"perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3811",345,"waved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3812",345,"the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3813",345,"on the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3814",345,"the side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3815",345,"by her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3816",345,"good-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3817",345,"but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3818",345,"asleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3819",345,"as though to protect it from cold.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3820",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3821",345,"I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3833",345,"Arthur's father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. Lucy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3837",345,"protect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has got","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3838",345,"her death-warrant. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3839",345,"her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3840",345,"her heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3851",345,"the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"3930",345,"night, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3931",345,"to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3932",345,"were in any way anæmic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3933",345,"gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3934",345,"seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3935",345,"needed any reminding, of _that_ night, and that it was here, on this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"3936",345,"very seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4108",345,"The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4109",345,"go than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4127",345,"bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4128",345,"is upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4129",345,"take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4130",345,"him--the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4131",345,"in. I heard him say:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4132",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4133",345,"""I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4134",345,"reward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long and afar","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4135",345,"off. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4136",345,"me by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4137",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4138",345,"He _is_ a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4139",345,"even when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias make a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4140",345,"startling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4141",345,"He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4142",345,"never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4143",345,"shall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4144",345,"his danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4145",345,"might have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now at any","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4146",345,"rate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn't get free from the strait-waistcoat","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4147",345,"that keeps him restrained, and he's chained to the wall in the padded","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4148",345,"room. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4149",345,"more deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4150",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4170",345,"""I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4171",345,"parted at the railway station at Whitby. Well, my dear, I got to Hull","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4172",345,"all right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4173",345,"feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4174",345,"knew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4175",345,"nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4176",345,"oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone out","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4177",345,"of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4178",345,"face has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4179",345,"remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. At","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4180",345,"least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4181",345,"terrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4182",345,"to recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4183",345,"tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4184",345,"wanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4185",345,"and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4186",345,"secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4187",345,"them, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul, and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4188",345,"next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4189",345,"and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4190",345,"about, added: 'I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4191",345,"anything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4192",345,"have no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4193",345,"to you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4194",345,"treat of.' I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4195",345,"poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4196",345,"_my_ being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4197",345,"felt a thrill of joy through me when I _knew_ that no other woman was a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4198",345,"cause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4199",345,"face while he sleeps. He is waking!...","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4200",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4201",345,"""When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4202",345,"from the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4203",345,"I saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4204",345,"let me look at it--for I knew then that I might find some clue to his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4205",345,"trouble--but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4206",345,"me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4207",345,"Then he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4208",345,"note-book, and he said to me very solemnly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4209",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4210",345,"""'Wilhelmina'--I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4211",345,"never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him--'you know,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4212",345,"dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4213",345,"secret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4214",345,"think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4215",345,"was all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4216",345,"fever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4217",345,"know it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.' For, my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4218",345,"dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4219",345,"complete. 'Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4220",345,"the book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4221",345,"know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4222",345,"the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.' He fell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4223",345,"back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4224",345,"have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4225",345,"afternoon, and am waiting her reply....","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4236",345,"happy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4237",345,"sat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his 'I will' firmly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4238",345,"and strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4239",345,"words seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please God, I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4240",345,"shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4241",345,"I have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4242",345,"chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4243",345,"is the first time I have written the words 'my husband'--left me alone","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4244",345,"with my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4245",345,"up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4246",345,"which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4247",345,"and for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4248",345,"to my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4249",345,"be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4250",345,"other; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4251",345,"or for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4252",345,"Lucy, it was the first time he took _his wife's_ hand, and said that it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4253",345,"was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4254",345,"through all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4255",345,"have said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4256",345,"shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4257",345,"year.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4258",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4259",345,"""Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4261",345,"except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4262",345,"and duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4263",345,"and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4313",345,"now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4314",345,"For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then one","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4315",345,"night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4316",345,"himself: ""Now I can wait; now I can wait."" The attendant came to tell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4317",345,"me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4318",345,"strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4319",345,"from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--I might","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4320",345,"almost say, ""cringing""--softness. I was satisfied with his present","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4321",345,"condition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4322",345,"but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4323",345,"thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4324",345,"coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4333",345,"he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is needful","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4334",345,"to him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4335",345,"offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He will","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4336",345,"only say: ""I don't take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4370",345,"and flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4371",345,"Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4372",345,"in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4373",345,"he became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4374",345,"would have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4375",345,"happened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4376",345,"calm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caught","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4377",345,"the patient's eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4378",345,"into the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4379",345,"ghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4380",345,"seemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4381",345,"some intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4382",345,"presently said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4383",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4384",345,"""You needn't tie me; I shall go quietly!"" Without trouble we came back","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4460",345,"that I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4461",345,"her appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4468",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4469",345,"""I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4470",345,"and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4471",345,"to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4472",345,"doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4473",345,"We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4474",345,"got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4475",345,"amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4476",345,"me. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4477",345,"for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4478",345,"however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4479",345,"with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4480",345,"high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4481",345,"make a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4482",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4483",345,"""'I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.' I reminded her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4484",345,"that a doctor's confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4485",345,"anxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4486",345,"matter in a word. 'Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4487",345,"myself, but all for him!' So I am quite free.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4488",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4489",345,"""I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4490",345,"the usual anæmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4491",345,"quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4492",345,"gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4493",345,"slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4494",345,"a few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4495",345,"analysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4496",345,"itself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4497",345,"satisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4498",345,"cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4499",345,"mental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4500",345,"times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4501",345,"regarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4502",345,"used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4503",345,"and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4504",345,"Miss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4505",345,"returned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4506",345,"have written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4507",345,"Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4508",345,"world. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4509",345,"were to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4510",345,"relations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4511",345,"your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4512",345,"her. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4513",345,"reason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4514",345,"wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4515",345,"what he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4516",345,"and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4517",345,"and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4518",345,"nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4519",345,"self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4520",345,"kindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4521",345,"noble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4522",345,"practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4523",345,"tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4524",345,"him. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4568",345,"course I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4573",345,"what he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4574",345,"come back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4586",345,"saw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4587",345,"ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4588",345,"very sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4589",345,"feel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4590",345,"struggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4591",345,"look under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4592",345,"all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4593",345,"geniality that I could see poor Lucy's pretense of animation merge into","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4594",345,"reality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4595",345,"gently round to his visit, and suavely said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4596",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4597",345,"""'My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4599",345,"see. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4600",345,"ghastly pale. To them I say: ""Pouf!""' And he snapped his fingers at me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4601",345,"and went on: 'But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4603",345,"which once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4604",345,"particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of--'know anything","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4605",345,"of a young ladies? He has his madams to play with, and to bring them","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4606",345,"back to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4607",345,"oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4608",345,"young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4609",345,"themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4610",345,"sorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4611",345,"smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4637",345,"_4 September._--Zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4638",345,"He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4639",345,"before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4640",345,"the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4641",345,"run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4642",345,"violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4643",345,"minutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4644",345,"into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4645",345,"attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4646",345,"appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4647",345,"other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4648",345,"understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4649",345,"some distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4650",345,"as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4651",345,"woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4652",345,"something directly. I cannot quite understand it.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4656",345,"_Later._--Another change in my patient. At five o'clock I looked in on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4657",345,"him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4658",345,"was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4659",345,"by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4660",345,"padding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4661",345,"conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4662",345,"his own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4663",345,"humour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4664",345,"sugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4665",345,"harvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4666",345,"box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4667",345,"a spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4668",345,"clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4669",345,"rise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4670",345,"far-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4671",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4672",345,"""All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4673",345,"it for myself!"" Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said:","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4674",345,"""Doctor, won't you be very good to me and let me have a little more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4675",345,"sugar? I think it would be good for me.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4676",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4677",345,"""And the flies?"" I said.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4678",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4679",345,"""Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4680",345,"it."" And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4681",345,"not argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4682",345,"as, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4683",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4685",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4686",345,"_Midnight._--Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4687",345,"whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4688",345,"own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4689",345,"his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4690",345,"the morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4691",345,"beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4692",345,"and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4693",345,"water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4694",345,"building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4695",345,"to endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4696",345,"his window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4697",345,"frenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4698",345,"inert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4699",345,"recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4700",345,"quite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4701",345,"hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4702",345,"over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4703",345,"fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4704",345,"the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4705",345,"me, so I asked him: ""Are you not going to keep flies any more?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4706",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4707",345,"""No,"" said he; ""I am sick of all that rubbish!"" He certainly is a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4708",345,"wonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4709",345,"mind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4710",345,"after all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4711",345,"and at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4745",345,"There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4746",345,"Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4747",345,"professionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and told","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4748",345,"her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4749",345,"stay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4750",345,"myself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4751",345,"shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy's weak","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4773",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4774",345,"""Right, my friend,"" he said, ""quite right! Better he not know as yet;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4775",345,"perhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4776",345,"shall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4777",345,"with the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4778",345,"as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God's madmen,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4779",345,"too--the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4780",345,"you do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledge","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4781",345,"in its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4782",345,"and breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here."" He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4783",345,"touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4784",345,"the same way. ""I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4795",345,"time comes.'"" I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4796",345,"he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4797",345,"he used long ago to do at lectures, and said: ""The good husbandman tell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4798",345,"you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4800",345,"the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4803",345,"there's some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell."" He broke","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4804",345,"off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4819",345,"When I described Lucy's symptoms--the same as before, but infinitely","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4821",345,"bag in which were many instruments and drugs, ""the ghastly paraphernalia","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4822",345,"of our beneficial trade,"" as he once called, in one of his lectures, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4823",345,"equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4824",345,"Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4825",345,"expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4826",345,"that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4827",345,"where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4828",345,"cause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4829",345,"daughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4830",345,"something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4831",345,"envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4832",345,"which it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4833",345,"selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4834",345,"of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4835",345,"knowledge of.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4836",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4837",345,"I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4838",345,"a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4839",345,"more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4840",345,"I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4841",345,"shown up to Lucy's room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4842",345,"was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4843",345,"red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4844",345,"her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4845",345,"hear. Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4846",345,"till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4847",345,"seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4848",345,"Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4849",345,"instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4850",345,"the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4851",345,"closed the door. ""My God!"" he said; ""this is dreadful. There is no time","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4852",345,"to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"4864",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4865",345,"""Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4866",345,"have been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4867",345,"myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4868",345,"sir, for coming."" When first the Professor's eye had lit upon him he had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4869",345,"been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4870",345,"his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4871",345,"seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4872",345,"him gravely as he held out his hand:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4873",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4874",345,"""Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4875",345,"bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that."" For he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4876",345,"suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. ""You are to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4877",345,"help her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4878",345,"best help.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4879",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4880",345,"""What can I do?"" asked Arthur hoarsely. ""Tell me, and I shall do it. My","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4881",345,"life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4882",345,"her."" The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4883",345,"knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4884",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4885",345,"""My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4886",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4887",345,"""What shall I do?"" There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4888",345,"quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. ""Come!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4889",345,"he said. ""You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4890",345,"me, better than my friend John."" Arthur looked bewildered, and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4891",345,"Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4892",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4893",345,"""Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4894",345,"or die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4895",345,"what we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4896",345,"the empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4897",345,"the more young and strong than me""--here Arthur took my hand and wrung","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4898",345,"it hard in silence--""but, now you are here, you are more good than us,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4899",345,"old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4900",345,"so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!"" Arthur turned to him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4901",345,"and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4902",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4903",345,"""If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4904",345,"understand----""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4905",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4906",345,"He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4907",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4908",345,"""Good boy!"" said Van Helsing. ""In the not-so-far-off you will be happy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4909",345,"that you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4910",345,"shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4911",345,"must leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4912",345,"her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4913",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4914",345,"We all went up to Lucy's room. Arthur by direction remained outside.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4915",345,"Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4916",345,"asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4917",345,"to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4918",345,"them on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4919",345,"coming over to the bed, said cheerily:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4920",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4921",345,"""Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4922",345,"child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes."" She had made","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4923",345,"the effort with success.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4924",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4925",345,"It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4926",345,"the extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4927",345,"flicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4928",345,"its potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4929",345,"satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4930",345,"coat. Then he added: ""You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4931",345,"over the table. Friend John, help to me!"" So neither of us looked whilst","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4932",345,"he bent over her.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4933",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4934",345,"Van Helsing turning to me, said:","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4935",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4936",345,"""He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4937",345,"defibrinate it.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4938",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4939",345,"Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4940",345,"operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4941",345,"back to poor Lucy's cheeks, and through Arthur's growing pallor the joy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4942",345,"of his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4943",345,"anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4944",345,"was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy's system must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4945",345,"have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4946",345,"But the Professor's face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4947",345,"his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4948",345,"heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: ""Do not stir an instant.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4949",345,"It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her."" When all was over I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4950",345,"could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4951",345,"arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4952",345,"man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4953",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4954",345,"""The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4955",345,"presently."" And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4956",345,"pillow to the patient's head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4957",345,"which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4958",345,"diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4959",345,"and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4960",345,"could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4961",345,"ways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4962",345,"me, saying: ""Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4963",345,"wine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4964",345,"much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4965",345,"his love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4966",345,"that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4967",345,"the operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4968",345,"can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4969",345,"her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4970",345,"have done. Good-bye.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4971",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4972",345,"When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4973",345,"but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4974",345,"breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4975",345,"The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4976",345,"whisper:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4977",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4978",345,"""What do you make of that mark on her throat?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4979",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4980",345,"""What do you make of it?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4981",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4982",345,"""I have not examined it yet,"" I answered, and then and there proceeded","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4983",345,"to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4984",345,"punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4985",345,"disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4986",345,"trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4987",345,"was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4988",345,"the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4989",345,"would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4990",345,"have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4991",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4992",345,"""Well?"" said Van Helsing.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4993",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4994",345,"""Well,"" said I, ""I can make nothing of it."" The Professor stood up. ""I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4995",345,"must go back to Amsterdam to-night,"" he said. ""There are books and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4996",345,"things there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4997",345,"must not let your sight pass from her.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4998",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"4999",345,"""Shall I have a nurse?"" I asked.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5000",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5001",345,"""We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5002",345,"she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5003",345,"the night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5004",345,"possible. And then we may begin.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5005",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5006",345,"""May begin?"" I said. ""What on earth do you mean?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5007",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5008",345,"""We shall see!"" he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5009",345,"later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5010",345,"up:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5011",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5012",345,"""Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5013",345,"shall not sleep easy hereafter!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5017",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5018",345,"_8 September._--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5019",345,"off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5020",345,"from what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5021",345,"and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5022",345,"absolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5023",345,"that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5024",345,"almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter's renewed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5025",345,"strength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5026",345,"preparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5027",345,"night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5028",345,"the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5029",345,"gratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5030",345,"sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5031",345,"and shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5032",345,"and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5033",345,"did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5034",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5035",345,"""You do not want to go to sleep?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5036",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5037",345,"""No; I am afraid.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5038",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5039",345,"""Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5040",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5041",345,"""Ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you a presage of horror!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5042",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5043",345,"""A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5044",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5045",345,"""I don't know; oh, I don't know. And that is what is so terrible. All","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5046",345,"this weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5047",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5048",345,"""But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5049",345,"I can promise that nothing will happen.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5050",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5051",345,"""Ah, I can trust you!"" I seized the opportunity, and said: ""I promise","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5052",345,"you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5053",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5054",345,"""You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5055",345,"sleep!"" And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5056",345,"back, asleep.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5057",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5058",345,"All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5059",345,"in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5060",345,"slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5061",345,"pendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5062",345,"dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5063",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5064",345,"In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5065",345,"myself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5066",345,"wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5067",345,"of the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5068",345,"day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5069",345,"zoöphagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5070",345,"past day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5071",345,"I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5072",345,"it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5073",345,"night mail and would join me early in the morning.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5077",345,"_9 September_.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5078",345,"Hillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5079",345,"brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5080",345,"exhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5081",345,"with me she looked sharply in my face and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5082",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5083",345,"""No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5084",345,"again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5085",345,"will sit up with you."" I would not argue the point, but went and had my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5086",345,"supper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5087",345,"made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5088",345,"excellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5089",345,"her own, where a cozy fire was burning. ""Now,"" she said, ""you must stay","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5090",345,"here. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5091",345,"sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5092",345,"bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5093",345,"shall call out, and you can come to me at once."" I could not but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5094",345,"acquiesce, for I was ""dog-tired,"" and could not have sat up had I tried.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5095",345,"So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5096",345,"I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5101",345,"_9 September._--I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5102",345,"that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5103",345,"a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5118",345,"_10 September._--I was conscious of the Professor's hand on my head, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5119",345,"started awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learn","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5120",345,"in an asylum, at any rate.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5121",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5122",345,"""And how is our patient?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5123",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5124",345,"""Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,"" I answered.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5125",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5126",345,"""Come, let us see,"" he said. And together we went into the room.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5127",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5128",345,"The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5129",345,"Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5130",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5131",345,"As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5132",345,"heard the Professor's low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5133",345,"deadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5134",345,"his exclamation of horror, ""Gott in Himmel!"" needed no enforcement from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5135",345,"his agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5136",345,"iron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5137",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5138",345,"There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5139",345,"white and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5140",345,"seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5141",345,"corpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5142",345,"in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5143",345,"stood to him, and he put it down again softly. ""Quick!"" he said. ""Bring","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5144",345,"the brandy."" I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5145",345,"He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5146",345,"wrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5147",345,"suspense said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5148",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5149",345,"""It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5150",345,"undone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5151",345,"to call on you yourself this time, friend John."" As he spoke, he was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5152",345,"dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5153",345,"had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5154",345,"possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5155",345,"without a moment's delay, we began the operation. After a time--it did","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5156",345,"not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one's blood, no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5157",345,"matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5158",345,"held up a warning finger. ""Do not stir,"" he said, ""but I fear that with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5159",345,"growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5160",345,"danger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5161",345,"of morphia."" He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5162",345,"intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5163",345,"subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5164",345,"that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5165",345,"cheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5166",345,"feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5167",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5168",345,"The Professor watched me critically. ""That will do,"" he said. ""Already?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5169",345,"I remonstrated. ""You took a great deal more from Art."" To which he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5170",345,"smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5171",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5172",345,"""He is her lover, her _fiancé_. You have work, much work, to do for her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5173",345,"and for others; and the present will suffice.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5174",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5175",345,"When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5176",345,"digital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5177",345,"leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5178",345,"he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5179",345,"myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5180",345,"whispered:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5181",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5182",345,"""Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5183",345,"unexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5184",345,"enjealous him, too. There must be none. So!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5185",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5186",345,"When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5187",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5188",345,"""You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5189",345,"rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5190",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5191",345,"I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5192",345,"had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5193",345,"felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5194",345,"what had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5195",345,"and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5196",345,"she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5197",345,"show for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5198",345,"sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5199",345,"punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5200",345,"edges--tiny though they were.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5201",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5202",345,"Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5203",345,"strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5204",345,"had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5205",345,"injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5206",345,"voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5207",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5208",345,"Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5209",345,"had happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5210",345,"came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5211",345,"said to me gratefully:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5212",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5213",345,"""We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5214",345,"must now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5215",345,"yourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5216",345,"do!"" As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5217",345,"for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5218",345,"drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5219",345,"imploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5220",345,"lips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5221",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5222",345,"Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5223",345,"""Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5224",345,"stay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5225",345,"I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5226",345,"reasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to think","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5227",345,"even the most not-probable. Good-night.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5228",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5229",345,"In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5230",345,"them might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5231",345,"when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing's wish that either he or I should sit","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5232",345,"up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the ""foreign","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5233",345,"gentleman."" I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5234",345,"I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy's account, that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5235",345,"their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5236",345,"similar instances of woman's kindness. I got back here in time for a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5237",345,"late dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waiting","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5238",345,"for sleep. It is coming.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5242",345,"_11 September._--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5243",345,"Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5244",345,"arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5245",345,"with much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed a great bundle of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5246",345,"white flowers.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5247",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5248",345,"""These are for you, Miss Lucy,"" he said.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5250",345,"""For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5251",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5252",345,"""Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines."" Here","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5253",345,"Lucy made a wry face. ""Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5254",345,"in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5255",345,"point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5256",345,"so much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5257",345,"that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5258",345,"you do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5259",345,"hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5260",345,"lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5261",345,"of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5262",345,"for in the Floridas, and find him all too late.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5263",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5264",345,"Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5265",345,"them. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5266",345,"half-disgust:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5267",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5268",345,"""Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5269",345,"these flowers are only common garlic.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5270",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5271",345,"To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5272",345,"iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5273",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5274",345,"""No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5275",345,"and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5276",345,"others if not for your own."" Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5277",345,"well be, he went on more gently: ""Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5278",345,"me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5279",345,"common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5280",345,"wreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5281",345,"inquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5282",345,"and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5283",345,"for you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5284",345,"help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5285",345,"where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5286",345,"I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5287",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5288",345,"We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5289",345,"actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5290",345,"that I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5291",345,"securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5292",345,"the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5293",345,"in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5294",345,"all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5295",345,"the fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5296",345,"presently I said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5297",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5298",345,"""Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5299",345,"this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5300",345,"would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5301",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5302",345,"""Perhaps I am!"" he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5303",345,"Lucy was to wear round her neck.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5304",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5305",345,"We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5306",345,"was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5307",345,"neck. The last words he said to her were:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5308",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5309",345,"""Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5310",345,"not to-night open the window or the door.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5311",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5312",345,"""I promise,"" said Lucy, ""and thank you both a thousand times for all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5313",345,"your kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5314",345,"friends?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5315",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5316",345,"As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5317",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5318",345,"""To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5319",345,"much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5320",345,"and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5321",345,"you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5324",345,"He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5325",345,"before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5326",345,"have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5338",345,"Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5339",345,"positively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5340",345,"right, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5341",345,"being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5342",345,"mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5343",345,"have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5344",345,"or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5345",345,"for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5346",345,"dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5347",345,"nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5357",345,"up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5360",345,"Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5362",345,"fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5363",345,"annual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5364",345,"but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5365",345,"Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an early","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5366",345,"riser. She greeted us warmly and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5367",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5368",345,"""You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5369",345,"asleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5370",345,"should disturb her."" The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5371",345,"rubbed his hands together, and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5372",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5373",345,"""Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,"" to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5374",345,"which she answered:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5375",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5376",345,"""You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy's state this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5378",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5379",345,"""How you do mean, ma'am?"" asked the Professor.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5380",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5381",345,"""Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5382",345,"her room. She was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming did","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5383",345,"not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5384",345,"horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5385",345,"a bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5386",345,"too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5387",345,"and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5388",345,"pleased with her, I am sure.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5389",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5391",345,"she had spoken, I watched the Professor's face, and saw it turn ashen","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5392",345,"grey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5393",345,"was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5394",345,"he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5395",345,"her room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5396",345,"forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5397",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5398",345,"Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5399",345,"raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5400",345,"his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5401",345,"and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5402",345,"that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5403",345,"his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. ""God! God!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5404",345,"God!"" he said. ""What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5405",345,"we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5406",345,"pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5407",345,"mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5408",345,"thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5409",345,"must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5410",345,"beset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!"" Suddenly he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5411",345,"jumped to his feet. ""Come,"" he said, ""come, we must see and act. Devils","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5412",345,"or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5413",345,"all the same."" He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5414",345,"went up to Lucy's room.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5415",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5416",345,"Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5417",345,"This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5418",345,"awful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5419",345,"infinite pity.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5420",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5421",345,"""As I expected,"" he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5422",345,"meant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5423",345,"began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5424",345,"operation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5425",345,"necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5426",345,"warning hand. ""No!"" he said. ""To-day you must operate. I shall provide.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5427",345,"You are weakened already."" As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5428",345,"up his shirt-sleeve.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5429",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5430",345,"Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5436",345,"flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5437",345,"was a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5438",345,"himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5615",345,"explanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn't cope in badinage","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5616",345,"with the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5617",345,"so I said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5618",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5619",345,"""Now, Mr. Bilder, we'll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5671",345,"penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5672",345,"prodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5673",345,"solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5692",345,"books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5693",345,"had fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5695",345,"thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5696",345,"into the Superintendent's study is almost unknown. Without an instant's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5697",345,"pause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5698",345,"as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5699",345,"too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5700",345,"balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5701",345,"Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5702",345,"sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5703",345,"little pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5704",345,"intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5705",345,"keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5706",345,"attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5707",345,"positively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5753",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5755",345,"sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5756",345,"know so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5757",345,"the next room--as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be--so that I might have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5758",345,"called him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5759",345,"the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5760",345,"would try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5761",345,"alone, I opened my door and called out: ""Is there anybody there?"" There","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5762",345,"was no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5763",345,"Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog's, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5764",345,"more fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5765",345,"see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5766",345,"wings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5767",345,"not to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5768",345,"seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5769",345,"said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5770",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5771",345,"""I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5772",345,"right.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5773",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5774",345,"I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5775",345,"and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5776",345,"not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5777",345,"and then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5778",345,"hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5779",345,"startled and a little frightened, and cried out: ""What is that?"" I tried","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5780",345,"to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5781",345,"hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5782",345,"the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5783",345,"crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5784",345,"The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5785",345,"aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5786",345,"wolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5787",345,"posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5788",345,"other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5789",345,"insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5790",345,"second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5791",345,"and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struck","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5792",345,"with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5793",345,"moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5794",345,"eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5795",345,"myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5796",345,"window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5797",345,"travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5798",345,"stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother's poor body,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5799",345,"which seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5800",345,"beat--weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5801",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5802",345,"The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5803",345,"consciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5804",345,"dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5805",345,"seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5806",345,"stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5807",345,"nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5808",345,"me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5809",345,"their bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5810",345,"came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5811",345,"over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5812",345,"broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5813",345,"dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5814",345,"had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5815",345,"to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5816",345,"open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5817",345,"in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5818",345,"mother's breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5819",345,"had told me, but I didn't like to remove them, and, besides, I would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5820",345,"have some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5821",345,"the maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5822",345,"to the dining-room to look for them.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5823",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5824",345,"My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5825",345,"on the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5826",345,"half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5827",345,"and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5828",345,"sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother's doctor uses for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5829",345,"her--oh! did use--was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5830",345,"in the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5831",345,"the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5832",345,"dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5833",345,"broken window.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5834",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5835",345,"The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5837",345,"shield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5838",345,"where they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5839",345,"gone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"5853",345,"mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5854",345,"finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5855",345,"the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5856",345,"hour--for it was now ten o'clock--and so rang and knocked again, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5857",345,"more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5858",345,"the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5859",345,"desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5860",345,"tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5861",345,"late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5862",345,"danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5863",345,"and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5864",345,"anywhere.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5865",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5866",345,"I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5867",345,"locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5868",345,"rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse's feet. They stopped at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5869",345,"gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5870",345,"When he saw me, he gasped out:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5871",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5872",345,"""Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5873",345,"not get my telegram?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5874",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5875",345,"I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5876",345,"telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5877",345,"and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5878",345,"raised his hat as he said solemnly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5879",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5880",345,"""Then I fear we are too late. God's will be done!"" With his usual","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5881",345,"recuperative energy, he went on: ""Come. If there be no way open to get","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5882",345,"in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5883",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5884",345,"We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5885",345,"window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5886",345,"handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5887",345,"attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5888",345,"with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5889",345,"opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5890",345,"was no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms, which were close at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5891",345,"hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5892",345,"dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5893",345,"servant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5894",345,"for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5895",345,"room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5896",345,"each other, and as we moved away he said: ""We can attend to them later.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5897",345,"Then we ascended to Lucy's room. For an instant or two we paused at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5898",345,"door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5899",345,"faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5900",345,"room.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5901",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5902",345,"How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5903",345,"mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5904",345,"sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5905",345,"broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5906",345,"fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5907",345,"drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5908",345,"mother's bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5909",345,"which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5910",345,"Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5911",345,"poor Lucy's breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5912",345,"listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5913",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5914",345,"""It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5915",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5916",345,"I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5917",345,"it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5918",345,"on the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5919",345,"fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5920",345,"but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5921",345,"occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5922",345,"hands. He said to me:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5923",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5924",345,"""I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5925",345,"Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5926",345,"get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5927",345,"that beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5928",345,"more.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5929",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5930",345,"I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5931",345,"women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5932",345,"affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5933",345,"sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5934",345,"them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5935",345,"them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5936",345,"was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5937",345,"Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5938",345,"as they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5939",345,"boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5940",345,"got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5941",345,"we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5942",345,"of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5943",345,"she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5944",345,"with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5945",345,"must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5946",345,"and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5947",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5948",345,"I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5949",345,"earnest. I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5950",345,"and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5951",345,"understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5952",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5953",345,"""If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5954",345,"away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon."" He went","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5955",345,"on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5956",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5957",345,"Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5958",345,"be of some effect. Lucy's heart beat a trifle more audibly to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5959",345,"stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5960",345,"face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5961",345,"a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5962",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5963",345,"""The first gain is ours! Check to the King!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5964",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5965",345,"We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5966",345,"her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5967",345,"that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5968",345,"still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5969",345,"ever seen her.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5970",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5971",345,"Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5972",345,"and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5973",345,"out of the room.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5974",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5975",345,"""We must consult as to what is to be done,"" he said as we descended the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5976",345,"stairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5977",345,"closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5978",345,"the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5979",345,"death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5980",345,"observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5981",345,"enough for our purposes. Van Helsing's sternness was somewhat relieved","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5982",345,"by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5983",345,"something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5984",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5985",345,"""What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5986",345,"another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl's life","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5987",345,"won't be worth an hour's purchase. You are exhausted already; I am","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5988",345,"exhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5989",345,"courage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5990",345,"veins for her?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5991",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5992",345,"""What's the matter with me, anyhow?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5993",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5994",345,"The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5995",345,"relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5996",345,"Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5997",345,"glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: ""Quincey Morris!"" and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5998",345,"rushed towards him with outstretched hands.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"5999",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6000",345,"""What brought you here?"" I cried as our hands met.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6001",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6002",345,"""I guess Art is the cause.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6003",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6004",345,"He handed me a telegram:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6005",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6006",345,"""Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6007",345,"Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6008",345,"Do not delay.--HOLMWOOD.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6009",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6010",345,"""I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6011",345,"me what to do.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6012",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6013",345,"Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6014",345,"the eyes as he said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6015",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6016",345,"""A brave man's blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6017",345,"trouble. You're a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6018",345,"us for all he's worth, but God sends us men when we want them.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6019",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6020",345,"Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6021",345,"to go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6022",345,"told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6023",345,"veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6024",345,"occasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6025",345,"and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6026",345,"Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6027",345,"good effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6028",345,"whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6029",345,"to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6030",345,"after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6031",345,"breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6032",345,"Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6033",345,"two of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6034",345,"thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6035",345,"of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6036",345,"He handed me the paper saying only: ""It dropped from Lucy's breast when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6037",345,"we carried her to the bath.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6038",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6039",345,"When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6040",345,"asked him: ""In God's name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6041",345,"mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?"" I was so bewildered that I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6042",345,"did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6043",345,"paper, saying:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6044",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6045",345,"""Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6046",345,"and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6047",345,"is it that you came to me to say?"" This brought me back to fact, and I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6048",345,"was all myself again.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6049",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6050",345,"""I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6051",345,"properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6052",345,"to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6053",345,"had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6054",345,"know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6055",345,"had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6056",345,"fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6057",345,"registrar and go on to the undertaker.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6058",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6059",345,"""Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6060",345,"sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6061",345,"love her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6062",345,"man. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6063",345,"more for it! Now go.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6064",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6065",345,"In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6066",345,"that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6067",345,"going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6068",345,"where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6069",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6070",345,"""When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6071",345,"ourselves?"" I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6072",345,"the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6073",345,"the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6074",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6075",345,"When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6076",345,"as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6077",345,"sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6078",345,"side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6079",345,"expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6080",345,"So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6081",345,"the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6082",345,"rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6083",345,"to me:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6084",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6085",345,"""Jack Seward, I don't want to shove myself in anywhere where I've no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6086",345,"right to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6087",345,"and wanted to marry her; but, although that's all past and gone, I can't","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6088",345,"help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that's wrong","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6089",345,"with her? The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can see","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6090",345,"that--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6091",345,"_another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6092",345,"Now I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a man","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6093",345,"must not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6094",345,"no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6095",345,"so?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6096",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6097",345,"""That's so,"" I said, and he went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6143",345,"come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6144",345,"Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6145",345,"and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6146",345,"poor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6147",345,"meant--that she had realised to the full her mother's death; so we tried","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6148",345,"what we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6149",345,"she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6150",345,"a long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6151",345,"her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6152",345,"into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6153",345,"took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6154",345,"over and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6155",345,"with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6156",345,"hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6170",345,"nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6171",345,"slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6172",345,"sleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6173",345,"haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6174",345,"gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6175",345,"sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6176",345,"changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6177",345,"one. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6178",345,"Quincey went off to meet him at the station.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6181",345,"and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6182",345,"colour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6183",345,"with emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6184",345,"the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6185",345,"grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6186",345,"were shortened. Arthur's presence, however, seemed to act as a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6187",345,"stimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6188",345,"had done since we arrived. He too pulled himself together, and spoke as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6263",345,"everything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, Renfield, there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6264",345,"is more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6265",345,"dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6266",345,"with any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier's cart with two men","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6267",345,"made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6268",345,"which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6269",345,"our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6270",345,"myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6271",345,"saw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6272",345,"Renfield's room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6273",345,"him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6274",345,"decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to ""shut up for a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6275",345,"foul-mouthed beggar,"" whereon our man accused him of robbing him and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6276",345,"wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6277",345,"swing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6278",345,"so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6279",345,"mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: 'Lor' bless","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6280",345,"yer, sir, I wouldn't mind what was said to me in a bloomin' madhouse. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6281",345,"pity ye and the guv'nor for havin' to live in the house with a wild","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6282",345,"beast like that.' Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6283",345,"where the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6284",345,"and curses and revilings from our man. I went down to see if I could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6285",345,"make out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6286",345,"well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6287",345,"ever occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6288",345,"genial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6289",345,"blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6290",345,"that he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6291",345,"say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6292",345,"hour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6293",345,"window of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6294",345,"attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6295",345,"on some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6296",345,"had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6297",345,"boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6298",345,"face, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6299",345,"patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6300",345,"knock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6301",345,"moment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The other","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6302",345,"fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6303",345,"heavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6304",345,"seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6305",345,"fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6306",345,"were both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6307",345,"began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6308",345,"on him, he began to shout: 'I'll frustrate them! They shan't rob me!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6309",345,"they shan't murder me by inches! I'll fight for my Lord and Master!' and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6310",345,"all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6311",345,"difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6312",345,"room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6354",345,"Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6355",345,"that it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6356",345,"father or mother, so that the dear old man's death is a real blow to me.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6357",345,"Jonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6358",345,"deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6359",345,"and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6362",345,"amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6363",345,"begins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6364",345,"helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6365",345,"shock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hard","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6366",345,"that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6367",345,"enabled him by our dear, good friend's aid to rise from clerk to master","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6368",345,"in a few years--should be so injured that the very essence of its","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6371",345,"for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6372",345,"tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6388",345,"and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6389",345,"this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6390",345,"been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--Lucy's mother","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6391",345,"and Arthur's father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6392",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6393",345,"I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6394",345,"go to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6395",345,"that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6396",345,"all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6397",345,"to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. ""Come, my child,"" he said;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6398",345,"""come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6399",345,"mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6400",345,"must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6401",345,"Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6402",345,"sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6403",345,"be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6404",345,"sleep."" Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6405",345,"face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6406",345,"quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6407",345,"should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6408",345,"as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6409",345,"window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy's neck, over the silk","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6410",345,"handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6411",345,"the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6412",345,"her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6413",345,"teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6414",345,"had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6415",345,"canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6416",345,"and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6417",345,"of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6418",345,"and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6419",345,"and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6420",345,"round--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6421",345,"and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6422",345,"I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6423",345,"flowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6424",345,"watching her.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6425",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6426",345,"Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6427",345,"She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6428",345,"her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6429",345,"so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6430",345,"became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6431",345,"certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6432",345,"stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6433",345,"waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6434",345,"mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6435",345,"spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6436",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6437",345,"At six o'clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6438",345,"into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy's face","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6439",345,"I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6440",345,"sharp whisper: ""Draw up the blind; I want light!"" Then he bent down,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6441",345,"and, with his face almost touching Lucy's, examined her carefully. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6442",345,"removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6443",345,"he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, ""Mein","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6444",345,"Gott!"" as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6445",345,"and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6446",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6447",345,"The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6448",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6449",345,"For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6450",345,"at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6451",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6452",345,"""She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6453",345,"me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6454",345,"let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6455",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6456",345,"I went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6457",345,"when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6458",345,"he thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6459",345,"was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6460",345,"Helsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6461",345,"hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6462",345,"perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6463",345,"shook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. ""Come,"" I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6464",345,"said, ""my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6465",345,"and easiest for her.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6466",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6467",345,"When we came into Lucy's room I could see that Van Helsing had, with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6468",345,"his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6469",345,"everything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6470",345,"hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6471",345,"came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6472",345,"softly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6473",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6474",345,"""Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!"" He was stooping to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6475",345,"kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. ""No,"" he whispered, ""not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6476",345,"yet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6477",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6478",345,"So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6479",345,"with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6480",345,"gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6481",345,"breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child's.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6482",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6483",345,"And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6484",345,"the night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6485",345,"gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6486",345,"sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6487",345,"were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6488",345,"such as I had never heard from her lips:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6489",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6490",345,"""Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!"" Arthur bent","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6491",345,"eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6492",345,"had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6493",345,"the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6494",345,"I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6495",345,"across the room.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6496",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6497",345,"""Not for your life!"" he said; ""not for your living soul and hers!"" And","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6498",345,"he stood between them like a lion at bay.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6499",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6500",345,"Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6501",345,"or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6502",345,"the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6503",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6504",345,"I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6505",345,"of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6506",345,"together. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6507",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6508",345,"Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6509",345,"putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing's great brown","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6510",345,"one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. ""My true friend,"" she said, in a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6511",345,"faint voice, but with untellable pathos, ""My true friend, and his! Oh,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6512",345,"guard him, and give me peace!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6513",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6514",345,"""I swear it!"" he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6515",345,"hand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6516",345,"to him: ""Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6517",345,"forehead, and only once.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6518",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6519",345,"Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6520",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6521",345,"Lucy's eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6522",345,"Arthur's arm, and drew him away.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6523",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6524",345,"And then Lucy's breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6525",345,"ceased.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6526",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6527",345,"""It is all over,"" said Van Helsing. ""She is dead!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6528",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6529",345,"I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6530",345,"sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6531",345,"nearly broke me down to see.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6532",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6533",345,"I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6534",345,"his face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6535",345,"Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6536",345,"recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6537",345,"deadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6538",345,"of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6539",345,"might be.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6564",345,"The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6566",345,"formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6568",345,"Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6572",345,"""She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It's quite a privilege to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6574",345,"establishment!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6575",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6576",345,"I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6577",345,"the disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6578",345,"at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6579",345,"father's funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6580",345,"bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6581",345,"ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6582",345,"papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6583",345,"foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6584",345,"so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6632",345,"instead of leaving traces of ""decay's effacing fingers,"" had but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6677",345,"shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6702",345,"her back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where Lucy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6703",345,"lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6704",345,"to those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6705",345,"putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6732",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6733",345,"The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6734",345,"Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6735",345,"and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6736",345,"cares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6737",345,"some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6738",345,"in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6739",345,"entailed property of Lucy's father's which now, in default of direct","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6740",345,"issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6741",345,"real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6742",345,"told us so much he went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6743",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6744",345,"""Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6745",345,"pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6746",345,"penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6747",345,"alliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6748",345,"collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6749",345,"her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6750",345,"right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6751",345,"have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6752",345,"Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6753",345,"disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6754",345,"wishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6755",345,"into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6756",345,"mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6757",345,"will--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6758",345,"treated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6759",345,"though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6760",345,"inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6761",345,"rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6762",345,"you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6763",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6764",345,"He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6765",345,"he was officially interested--of so great a tragedy, was an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6766",345,"object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6767",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6768",345,"He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6769",345,"see Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6770",345,"us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6771",345,"criticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o'clock, so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6772",345,"a little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6773",345,"very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6774",345,"true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6775",345,"there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6776",345,"once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6777",345,"explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6778",345,"less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fiancée_","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6779",345,"quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6780",345,"exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6781",345,"the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6782",345,"as we could avoid were saved.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6783",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6784",345,"Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6785",345,"manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6786",345,"much-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6787",345,"attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6788",345,"bitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6789",345,"was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6790",345,"constraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6791",345,"bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6792",345,"felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6793",345,"led me in, saying huskily:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6794",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6795",345,"""You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6796",345,"no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don't know how to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6797",345,"thank you for all you have done for her. I can't think yet....""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6798",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6799",345,"Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6800",345,"laid his head on my breast, crying:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6801",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6802",345,"""Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6803",345,"all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6804",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6805",345,"I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6806",345,"expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6807",345,"shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6808",345,"heart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6809",345,"softly to him:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6810",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6811",345,"""Come and look at her.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6812",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6813",345,"Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6814",345,"God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6815",345,"loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6816",345,"fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6817",345,"last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6818",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6819",345,"""Jack, is she really dead?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6820",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6821",345,"I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for I felt","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6822",345,"that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6823",345,"I could help--that it often happened that after death faces became","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6824",345,"softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6825",345,"especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6826",345,"suffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6827",345,"kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6828",345,"long, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6829",345,"coffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6830",345,"and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6831",345,"fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6832",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6833",345,"I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6834",345,"good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker's men","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6835",345,"to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6836",345,"came out of the room again I told him of Arthur's question, and he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6837",345,"replied:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6838",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6839",345,"""I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6840",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6841",345,"We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6842",345,"the best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6843",345,"when we had lit our cigars he said--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6844",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6845",345,"""Lord----""; but Arthur interrupted him:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6859",345,"""Call me what you will,"" he said. ""I hope I may always have the title of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6860",345,"a friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6861",345,"your goodness to my poor dear."" He paused a moment, and went on: ""I know","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6862",345,"that she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6863",345,"rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember""--the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6864",345,"Professor nodded--""you must forgive me.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6865",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6866",345,"He answered with a grave kindness:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6867",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6868",345,"""I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6869",345,"violence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not--that you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6870",345,"cannot--trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6871",345,"more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot--and may","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6872",345,"not--and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6873",345,"shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6874",345,"though the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6875",345,"first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6876",345,"dear sake to whom I swore to protect.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6877",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6881",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6882",345,"The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6883",345,"speak, and finally said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6884",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6885",345,"""May I ask you something now?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6895",345,"letters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6896",345,"be sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took them","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6897",345,"before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6900",345,"safe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6914",345,"all, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"6941",345,"President of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6942",345,"hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6943",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6944",345,"We came back to town quietly, taking a 'bus to Hyde Park Corner.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6945",345,"Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6946",345,"we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6947",345,"sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us think","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6948",345,"of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6949",345,"Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6950",345,"before I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can't go on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6951",345,"for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6952",345,"pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6953",345,"was my husband, and we didn't know anybody who saw us--and we didn't","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6954",345,"care if they did--so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6955",345,"girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano's,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6956",345,"when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6957",345,"under his breath: ""My God!"" I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6958",345,"fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6959",345,"quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6960",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6961",345,"He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6962",345,"half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6963",345,"black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6964",345,"girl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6965",345,"and so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face; it was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6966",345,"hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6967",345,"the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal's.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6968",345,"Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6969",345,"feared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6970",345,"Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6971",345,"I knew as much about it as he did: ""Do you see who it is?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6972",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6973",345,"""No, dear,"" I said; ""I don't know him; who is it?"" His answer seemed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6974",345,"shock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6975",345,"to me, Mina, to whom he was speaking:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6976",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6977",345,"""It is the man himself!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6978",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6979",345,"The poor dear was evidently terrified at something--very greatly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6980",345,"terrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6981",345,"support him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6982",345,"the shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6983",345,"off. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6984",345,"moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6985",345,"hansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6986",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6987",345,"""I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6988",345,"so! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if I only knew!"" He was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6989",345,"distressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6990",345,"subject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6991",345,"away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a little","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6992",345,"further, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6993",345,"a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6994",345,"After a few minutes' staring at nothing, Jonathan's eyes closed, and he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6995",345,"went quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I thought it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6996",345,"was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twenty","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6997",345,"minutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6998",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"6999",345,"""Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7000",345,"Come, and we'll have a cup of tea somewhere."" He had evidently forgotten","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7001",345,"all about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7002",345,"this episode had reminded him of. I don't like this lapsing into","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7003",345,"forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. I must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7004",345,"not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehow","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7005",345,"learn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7006",345,"must open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7007",345,"I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"7027",345,"_22 September._--It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7028",345,"taken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7029",345,"in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy's death as any","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7030",345,"of us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If America","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7031",345,"can go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7032",345,"indeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7033",345,"journey. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7034",345,"to-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7035",345,"only be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7036",345,"he has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor old","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7037",345,"fellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7038",345,"iron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7039",345,"some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7040",345,"standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7041",345,"the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy's veins; I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7042",345,"could see Van Helsing's face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7043",345,"saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7044",345,"and that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7045",345,"the other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7046",345,"away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7047",345,"moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7048",345,"hysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7049",345,"that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7050",345,"terrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7051",345,"the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7052",345,"till he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a woman","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7053",345,"does. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7054",345,"circumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7055",345,"manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grew","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7056",345,"grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7057",345,"His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7058",345,"forceful and mysterious. He said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7059",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7060",345,"""Ah, you don't comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7061",345,"though I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7062",345,"no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7063",345,"just the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7064",345,"door and say, 'May I come in?' is not the true laughter. No! he is a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7065",345,"king, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7066",345,"time of suitability. He say, 'I am here.' Behold, in example I grieve my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7067",345,"heart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, though","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7068",345,"I am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7069",345,"sufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7070",345,"grave--laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7071",345,"coffin and say 'Thud! thud!' to my heart, till it send back the blood","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7072",345,"from my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy--that dear boy, so of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7073",345,"the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7074",345,"hair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yet","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7075",345,"when he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7076",345,"father-heart yearn to him as to no other man--not even to you, friend","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7077",345,"John, for we are more level in experiences than father and son--yet even","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7078",345,"at such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7079",345,"'Here I am! here I am!' till the blood come dance back and bring some of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7080",345,"the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7081",345,"a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7082",345,"troubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7083",345,"tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7084",345,"tears that burn as they fall--all dance together to the music that he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7085",345,"make with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7086",345,"he is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7087",345,"tight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7088",345,"like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7089",345,"become too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"7341",345,"end. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7342",345,"friend on ""The Exeter News"" told him that memory was everything in such","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7343",345,"work--that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7344",345,"spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7345",345,"interview; I shall try to record it _verbatim_.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7346",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7347",345,"It was half-past two o'clock when the knock came. I took my courage _à","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7348",345,"deux mains_ and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7349",345,"announced ""Dr. Van Helsing.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7350",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7351",345,"I rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7352",345,"strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7353",345,"a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7354",345,"of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7355",345,"head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7356",345,"clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7357",345,"mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7358",345,"nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7359",345,"mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7360",345,"straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7361",345,"such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7362",345,"but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7363",345,"widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man's moods. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7364",345,"said to me:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7365",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7366",345,"""Mrs. Harker, is it not?"" I bowed assent.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7367",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7368",345,"""That was Miss Mina Murray?"" Again I assented.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7369",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7370",345,"""It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7371",345,"child Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7372",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7373",345,"""Sir,"" I said, ""you could have no better claim on me than that you were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7374",345,"a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra."" And I held out my hand. He took","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7375",345,"it and said tenderly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7376",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7377",345,"""Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7378",345,"good, but I had yet to learn----"" He finished his speech with a courtly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7379",345,"bow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7380",345,"once began:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7381",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7382",345,"""I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7383",345,"to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7384",345,"with her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary--you need not look","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7385",345,"surprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7386",345,"imitation of you--and in that diary she traces by inference certain","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7387",345,"things to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7388",345,"great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7389",345,"kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7390",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7391",345,"""I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7392",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7393",345,"""Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not always","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7394",345,"so with young ladies.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7395",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7396",345,"""No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7397",345,"if you like.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7398",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7399",345,"""Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour."" I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7400",345,"could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit--I suppose it is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7401",345,"some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7402",345,"mouths--so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7403",345,"bow, and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7404",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7405",345,"""May I read it?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7406",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7407",345,"""If you wish,"" I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7408",345,"an instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7409",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7410",345,"""Oh, you so clever woman!"" he said. ""I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7411",345,"man of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7412",345,"And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7413",345,"Alas! I know not the shorthand."" By this time my little joke was over,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7414",345,"and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7415",345,"workbasket and handed it to him.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7416",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7417",345,"""Forgive me,"" I said: ""I could not help it; but I had been thinking that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7418",345,"it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7419",345,"have time to wait--not on my account, but because I know your time must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7420",345,"be precious--I have written it out on the typewriter for you.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7421",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7422",345,"He took it and his eyes glistened. ""You are so good,"" he said. ""And may","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7423",345,"I read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7424",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7425",345,"""By all means,"" I said, ""read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7426",345,"can ask me questions whilst we eat."" He bowed and settled himself in a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7427",345,"chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7428",345,"whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7429",345,"disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7430",345,"the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7431",345,"took me by both hands.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7432",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7433",345,"""Oh, Madam Mina,"" he said, ""how can I say what I owe to you? This paper","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"7441",345,"and those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7442",345,"you are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7443",345,"your husband will be blessed in you.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7444",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"7449",345,"him and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7450",345,"have so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"7474",345,"which led to his brain fever."" And here the whole thing seemed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7475",345,"overwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7476",345,"experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7477",345,"has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7478",345,"was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7479",345,"him, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my hands","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7480",345,"and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7481",345,"hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7482",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7483",345,"""My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"7486",345,"nobility that I feel more than ever--and it has grown with my advancing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"7488",345,"full of respect for you, and you have given me hope--hope, not in what I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7489",345,"am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7490",345,"happy--good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7491",345,"the children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7492",345,"use to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"7500",345,"want to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7501",345,"will ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"7515",345,"fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7516",345,"have even half believed some very strange things."" He reassured me by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"7522",345,"an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"7866",345,"For a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her life","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7867",345,"struck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7868",345,"him:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7869",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7870",345,"""Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?"" He raised his head and looked at me, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7871",345,"somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. ""Would I were!"" he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7872",345,"said. ""Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7873",345,"friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7874",345,"you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7875",345,"my life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7876",345,"now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7877",345,"fearful death? Ah no!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7878",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7879",345,"""Forgive me,"" said I. He went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7880",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7881",345,"""My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7882",345,"for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7883",345,"expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7884",345,"truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7885",345,"believed the 'no' of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7886",345,"concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to prove","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7887",345,"it. Dare you come with me?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7888",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7889",345,"This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7890",345,"excepted from the category, jealousy.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7891",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7892",345,"    ""And prove the very truth he most abhorred.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7893",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7894",345,"He saw my hesitation, and spoke:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7895",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7896",345,"""The logic is simple, no madman's logic this time, jumping from tussock","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7897",345,"to tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7898",345,"at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7899",345,"very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7900",345,"I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7901",345,"in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7902",345,"say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7903",345,"in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7904",345,"will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7905",345,"wish to learn. And then----""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7906",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7907",345,"""And then?"" He took a key from his pocket and held it up. ""And then we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7908",345,"spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7909",345,"the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7910",345,"Arthur."" My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7911",345,"ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7912",345,"heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7913",345,"passing....","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7914",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7915",345,"We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7916",345,"altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7917",345,"throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7918",345,"similarity to those which had been on Lucy's throat. They were smaller,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7919",345,"and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7920",345,"attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7921",345,"animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7922",345,"that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7923",345,"heights of London. ""Out of so many harmless ones,"" he said, ""there may","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7924",345,"be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7925",345,"sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7926",345,"the Zoölogical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7927",345,"there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7928",345,"a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7929",345,"week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7930",345,"Heath and in every alley in the place until this 'bloofer lady' scare","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7931",345,"came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7932",345,"this poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7933",345,"might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7934",345,"to play with the 'bloofer lady.'""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7935",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7936",345,"""I hope,"" said Van Helsing, ""that when you are sending the child home","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7937",345,"you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7938",345,"to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7939",345,"night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7940",345,"not let it away for some days?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7941",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7942",345,"""Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7943",345,"healed.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7944",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7945",345,"Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7946",345,"the sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7947",345,"was, he said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7948",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7949",345,"""There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7950",345,"somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7951",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7952",345,"We dined at ""Jack Straw's Castle"" along with a little crowd of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7953",345,"bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o'clock we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7954",345,"started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7955",345,"made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7956",345,"radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7957",345,"went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7958",345,"locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7959",345,"last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7960",345,"police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7961",345,"the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty--for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7962",345,"it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we found","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7963",345,"the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7964",345,"and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7965",345,"precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7966",345,"courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7967",345,"companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7968",345,"carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7969",345,"one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7970",345,"fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7971",345,"proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7972",345,"with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7973",345,"days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7974",345,"turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7975",345,"beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7976",345,"stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7977",345,"brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7978",345,"candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7979",345,"imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7980",345,"not the only thing which could pass away.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7981",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7982",345,"Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7983",345,"that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7984",345,"dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7985",345,"made assurance of Lucy's coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7986",345,"out a turnscrew.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7987",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7988",345,"""What are you going to do?"" I asked.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7989",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7990",345,"""To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced."" Straightway he began","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7991",345,"taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7992",345,"casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7993",345,"to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7994",345,"stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7995",345,"hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: ""You shall see,"" and again","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7996",345,"fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7997",345,"through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7998",345,"made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"7999",345,"the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8000",345,"doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8001",345,"such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8002",345,"stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8003",345,"the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8004",345,"edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8005",345,"coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8006",345,"look.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8007",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8008",345,"I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8009",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8010",345,"It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8011",345,"Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8012",345,"and so emboldened to proceed in his task. ""Are you satisfied now, friend","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8013",345,"John?"" he asked.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8014",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8015",345,"I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8016",345,"I answered him:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8017",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8018",345,"""I am satisfied that Lucy's body is not in that coffin; but that only","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8019",345,"proves one thing.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8020",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8021",345,"""And what is that, friend John?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8022",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8023",345,"""That it is not there.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8024",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8025",345,"""That is good logic,"" he said, ""so far as it goes. But how do you--how","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8026",345,"can you--account for it not being there?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8027",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8028",345,"""Perhaps a body-snatcher,"" I suggested. ""Some of the undertaker's people","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8029",345,"may have stolen it."" I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8030",345,"the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. ""Ah","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8031",345,"well!"" he said, ""we must have more proof. Come with me.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8032",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8033",345,"He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8034",345,"them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8035",345,"bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8036",345,"locked it. He handed me the key, saying: ""Will you keep it? You had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8037",345,"better be assured."" I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8038",345,"bound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. ""A key is nothing,"" I said;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8039",345,"""there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8040",345,"of that kind."" He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8041",345,"told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8042",345,"the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8043",345,"figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8044",345,"sight.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8045",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8046",345,"It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8047",345,"clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8048",345,"unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8049",345,"and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8050",345,"observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8051",345,"a dreary, miserable time.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8052",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8053",345,"Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8054",345,"streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8055",345,"farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8056",345,"Professor's side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8057",345,"too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8058",345,"stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8059",345,"early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8060",345,"juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8061",345,"figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8062",345,"by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8063",345,"rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8064",345,"coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8065",345,"he saw me he held it out to me, and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8066",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8067",345,"""Are you satisfied now?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8068",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8069",345,"""No,"" I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8070",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8071",345,"""Do you not see the child?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8072",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8073",345,"""Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?"" I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8074",345,"asked.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8075",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8076",345,"""We shall see,"" said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8077",345,"out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8078",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8079",345,"When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8080",345,"trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child's throat. It was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8081",345,"without a scratch or scar of any kind.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8082",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8083",345,"""Was I right?"" I asked triumphantly.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8084",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8085",345,"""We were just in time,"" said the Professor thankfully.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8086",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8087",345,"We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8088",345,"about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8089",345,"give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8090",345,"have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8091",345,"So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8092",345,"heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8093",345,"it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8094",345,"well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman's heavy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8095",345,"tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8096",345,"he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8097",345,"of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8098",345,"cab near the ""Spaniards,"" and drove to town.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8099",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8100",345,"I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours'","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8101",345,"sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8102",345,"go with him on another expedition.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8106",345,"_27 September._--It was two o'clock before we found a suitable","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8107",345,"opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8108",345,"and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8109",345,"away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8110",345,"the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8111",345,"morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8112",345,"want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8113",345,"reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8114",345,"place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8115",345,"incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8116",345,"Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8117",345,"nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8118",345,"open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8119",345,"eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8120",345,"and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8121",345,"no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8122",345,"courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8123",345,"last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8124",345,"streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy's coffin, and I followed.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8125",345,"He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8126",345,"of surprise and dismay shot through me.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8127",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8128",345,"There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8129",345,"funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8130",345,"could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8131",345,"before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8132",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8133",345,"""Is this a juggle?"" I said to him.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8134",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8135",345,"""Are you convinced now?"" said the Professor in response, and as he spoke","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8136",345,"he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8137",345,"dead lips and showed the white teeth.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8138",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8139",345,"""See,"" he went on, ""see, they are even sharper than before. With this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8140",345,"and this""--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8141",345,"it--""the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8142",345,"John?"" Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I _could_ not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8143",345,"accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8144",345,"argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8145",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8146",345,"""She may have been placed here since last night.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8147",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8148",345,"""Indeed? That is so, and by whom?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8149",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8150",345,"""I do not know. Some one has done it.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8151",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8152",345,"""And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8153",345,"look so."" I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8154",345,"seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8155",345,"triumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8156",345,"the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8157",345,"examining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8158",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8159",345,"""Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8160",345,"some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8161",345,"when she was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8162",345,"that, friend John, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8163",345,"he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8164",345,"is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8165",345,"the Un-Dead sleep at home""--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8166",345,"his arm to designate what to a vampire was ""home""--""their face show what","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8167",345,"they are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8168",345,"the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8169",345,"it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep."" This turned my blood","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8170",345,"cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8171",345,"theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8172",345,"idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8173",345,"my face, for he said almost joyously:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8174",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8175",345,"""Ah, you believe now?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8176",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8177",345,"I answered: ""Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8178",345,"accept. How will you do this bloody work?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8179",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8180",345,"""I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8181",345,"drive a stake through her body."" It made me shudder to think of so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8182",345,"mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8183",345,"was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8184",345,"shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8185",345,"called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8186",345,"or all objective?","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8187",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8188",345,"I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8189",345,"if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8190",345,"snap, and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8191",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8192",345,"""I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8193",345,"did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8194",345,"to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8195",345,"thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8196",345,"simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8197",345,"now would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8198",345,"want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8199",345,"wounds on Lucy's throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child's at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8200",345,"the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8201",345,"to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8202",345,"beautiful in a whole week, after she die--if you know of this and know","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8203",345,"of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8204",345,"and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8205",345,"Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8206",345,"took him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8207",345,"because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8208",345,"good-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8209",345,"this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8210",345,"killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8211",345,"have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8212",345,"he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8213",345,"sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8214",345,"his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8215",345,"will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8216",345,"an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8217",345,"I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8218",345,"must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8219",345,"must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8220",345,"him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8221",345,"made up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8222",345,"that all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8223",345,"churchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8224",345,"Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8225",345,"and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8226",345,"shall all have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8228",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8245",345,"Therefore I shall fix some things she like not--garlic and a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8340",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8341",345,"""I accept your limitation,"" said Van Helsing, ""and all I ask of you is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8342",345,"that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8343",345,"consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8344",345,"reservations.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8345",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8346",345,"""Agreed!"" said Arthur; ""that is only fair. And now that the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8347",345,"_pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8351",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8352",345,"Arthur's face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8353",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8354",345,"""Where poor Lucy is buried?"" The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: ""And","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8355",345,"when there?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8356",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8357",345,"""To enter the tomb!"" Arthur stood up.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8358",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8359",345,"""Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8360",345,"I see that you are in earnest."" He sat down again, but I could see that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8361",345,"he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8362",345,"silence until he asked again:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8363",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8364",345,"""And when in the tomb?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8365",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8366",345,"""To open the coffin.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8367",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8368",345,"""This is too much!"" he said, angrily rising again. ""I am willing to be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8369",345,"patient in all things that are reasonable; but in this--this desecration","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8370",345,"of the grave--of one who----"" He fairly choked with indignation. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8371",345,"Professor looked pityingly at him.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8372",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8373",345,"""If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend,"" he said, ""God knows I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8374",345,"would. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8375",345,"for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8376",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8377",345,"Arthur looked up with set white face and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8380",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8381",345,"""Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?"" said Van Helsing.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8383",345,"on?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8386",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8392",345,"Arthur jumped to his feet.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8393",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8394",345,"""Good God!"" he cried. ""What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8395",345,"she been buried alive?"" He groaned in anguish that not even hope could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8396",345,"soften.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8397",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8407",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8410",345,"Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8411",345,"torture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8412",345,"cast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad to speak such things, or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8413",345,"am I mad to listen to them? Don't dare to think more of such a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8414",345,"desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8415",345,"duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8417",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8418",345,"Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8419",345,"said, gravely and sternly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8420",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8421",345,"""My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8422",345,"to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8423",345,"now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8424",345,"later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8425",345,"fulfilment even than I am, then--then I shall do my duty, whatever it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8426",345,"may seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship's wishes I shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8427",345,"hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8428",345,"you will."" His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8429",345,"pity:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8430",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8431",345,"""But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8432",345,"acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8433",345,"my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8434",345,"the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8435",345,"you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8436",345,"to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8437",345,"much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8438",345,"to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8439",345,"then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her--I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8440",345,"am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8441",345,"gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8442",345,"lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8443",345,"and days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8444",345,"even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely."" He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8445",345,"said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8446",345,"by it. He took the old man's hand and said in a broken voice:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8447",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8448",345,"""Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8455",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8456",345,"DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8457",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8458",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8459",345,"It was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got into the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8460",345,"churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8461",345,"of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8462",345,"the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8463",345,"in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8464",345,"well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8465",345,"sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8466",345,"that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8467",345,"to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8468",345,"hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8469",345,"entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8470",345,"He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8471",345,"forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8472",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8473",345,"""You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8474",345,"coffin?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8475",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8476",345,"""It was."" The Professor turned to the rest saying:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8477",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8478",345,"""You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me."" He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8479",345,"took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8480",345,"looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8481",345,"forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8482",345,"at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8483",345,"the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8484",345,"again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8485",345,"Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8486",345,"recoiled.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8487",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8488",345,"The coffin was empty!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8489",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8490",345,"For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8491",345,"Quincey Morris:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8492",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8493",345,"""Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn't ask","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8494",345,"such a thing ordinarily--I wouldn't so dishonour you as to imply a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8495",345,"doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8496",345,"Is this your doing?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8497",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8498",345,"""I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8499",345,"touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8500",345,"I came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8501",345,"was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8502",345,"saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8503",345,"day-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8504",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8505",345,"""Yes.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8506",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8507",345,"""That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8508",345,"and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8509",345,"here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8510",345,"all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8511",345,"that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8512",345,"which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8513",345,"night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8514",345,"garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8515",345,"bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8516",345,"outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8517",345,"So""--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--""now to the outside.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8518",345,"He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8519",345,"door behind him.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8520",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8521",345,"Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8522",345,"that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8523",345,"gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8524",345,"passing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man's life; how sweet it was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8525",345,"to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8526",345,"humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8527",345,"hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8528",345,"in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8529",345,"could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8530",345,"mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8531",345,"throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing's conclusions. Quincey","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8532",345,"Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8533",345,"accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8534",345,"stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8535",345,"tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8536",345,"definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8537",345,"thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8538",345,"napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8539",345,"dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8540",345,"mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8541",345,"strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8542",345,"setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8543",345,"asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8544",345,"also, as they too were curious. He answered:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8545",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8546",345,"""I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8547",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8548",345,"""And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?"" asked Quincey.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8549",345,"""Great Scott! Is this a game?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8550",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8551",345,"""It is.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8552",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8553",345,"""What is that which you are using?"" This time the question was by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8554",345,"Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8555",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8556",345,"""The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence."" It was an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8557",345,"answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8558",345,"that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor's, a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8559",345,"purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8560",345,"impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8561",345,"assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8562",345,"one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8563",345,"been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8564",345,"who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8565",345,"within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8566",345,"yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8567",345,"or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8568",345,"mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8569",345,"woeful presage through the night.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8570",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8571",345,"There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8572",345,"Professor a keen ""S-s-s-s!"" He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8573",345,"we saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held something","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8574",345,"dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8575",345,"moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8576",345,"prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8577",345,"We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8578",345,"fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8579",345,"child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8580",345,"were starting forward, but the Professor's warning hand, seen by us as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8581",345,"he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8582",345,"white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8583",345,"clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8584",345,"and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8585",345,"Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8586",345,"turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8587",345,"wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8588",345,"all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8589",345,"tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8590",345,"concentrated light that fell on Lucy's face we could see that the lips","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8591",345,"were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8592",345,"chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8593",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8594",345,"We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8595",345,"Van Helsing's iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8596",345,"not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8597",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8598",345,"When Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8599",345,"shape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8600",345,"when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy's eyes in form","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8601",345,"and colour; but Lucy's eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8602",345,"the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8603",345,"passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8604",345,"done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8605",345,"light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8606",345,"how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8607",345,"the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8608",345,"clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8609",345,"over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8610",345,"was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8611",345,"she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8612",345,"back and hid his face in his hands.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8613",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8614",345,"She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8615",345,"said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8616",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8617",345,"""Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8618",345,"hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8619",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8620",345,"There was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8621",345,"tingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8622",345,"who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8623",345,"a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8624",345,"was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8625",345,"them his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8626",345,"suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8627",345,"the tomb.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8628",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8629",345,"When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8630",345,"arrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8631",345,"shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8632",345,"quiver from Van Helsing's iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8633",345,"malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8634",345,"mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8635",345,"out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8636",345,"the flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes, and the lovely,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8637",345,"blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8638",345,"the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death--if looks could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8639",345,"kill--we saw it at that moment.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8640",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8641",345,"And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8642",345,"between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8643",345,"entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8644",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8645",345,"""Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8646",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8647",345,"Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8648",345,"answered:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8649",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8650",345,"""Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8651",345,"this ever any more;"" and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8652",345,"simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8653",345,"click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8654",345,"to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8655",345,"emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8656",345,"amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8657",345,"body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8658",345,"where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8659",345,"relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8660",345,"to the edges of the door.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8661",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8662",345,"When this was done, he lifted the child and said:","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8663",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8664",345,"""Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8665",345,"funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8666",345,"friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8667",345,"the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8668",345,"to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8669",345,"night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8670",345,"him, as on the other night; and then to home."" Coming close to Arthur,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8671",345,"he said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8672",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8673",345,"""My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8674",345,"back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8675",345,"waters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8676",345,"passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8677",345,"overmuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8678",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8679",345,"Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8680",345,"on the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8681",345,"slept with more or less reality of sleep.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8682",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8683",345,"       *       *       *       *       *","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8684",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8685",345,"_29 September, night._--A little before twelve o'clock we three--Arthur,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8686",345,"Quincey Morris, and myself--called for the Professor. It was odd to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8687",345,"notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8688",345,"course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8689",345,"us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8690",345,"strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8691",345,"gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8692",345,"that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8693",345,"ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8694",345,"long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8695",345,"fair weight.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8696",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8697",345,"When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8698",345,"the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8699",345,"Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8700",345,"behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8701",345,"two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8702",345,"ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8703",345,"by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy's coffin we all looked--Arthur","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8704",345,"trembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8705",345,"death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8706",345,"loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy's shape without her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8707",345,"soul. I could see even Arthur's face grow hard as he looked. Presently","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8708",345,"he said to Van Helsing:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8709",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8710",345,"""Is this really Lucy's body, or only a demon in her shape?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8711",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8712",345,"""It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8713",345,"as she was, and is.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8714",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8715",345,"She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8716",345,"the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8717",345,"see--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8718",345,"devilish mockery of Lucy's sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8719",345,"methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8720",345,"placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8721",345,"plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8722",345,"a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8723",345,"flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8724",345,"round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8725",345,"three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8726",345,"was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8727",345,"as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8728",345,"me, a doctor's preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8729",345,"bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8730",345,"to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8731",345,"courage, and remained silent and quiet.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8732",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8733",345,"When all was ready, Van Helsing said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8734",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8735",345,"""Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8736",345,"experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8737",345,"of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8738",345,"curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8739",345,"adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8740",345,"die from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8741",345,"on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8742",345,"ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8743",345,"that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8744",345,"when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8745",345,"have become _nosferatu_, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8746",345,"all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8747",345,"The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8748",345,"children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8749",345,"she live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8750",345,"power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8751",345,"so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8752",345,"wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8753",345,"unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8754",345,"this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8755",345,"lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8756",345,"night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8757",345,"shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8758",345,"be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8759",345,"To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8760",345,"right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8761",345,"night when sleep is not: 'It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8762",345,"was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8763",345,"herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?' Tell me if there be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8764",345,"such a one amongst us?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8765",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8766",345,"We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8767",345,"kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8768",345,"Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8769",345,"said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8770",345,"snow:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8771",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8772",345,"""My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8773",345,"what I am to do, and I shall not falter!"" Van Helsing laid a hand on his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8774",345,"shoulder, and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8775",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8776",345,"""Brave lad! A moment's courage, and it is done. This stake must be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8777",345,"driven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal--be not deceived in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8778",345,"that--but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8779",345,"than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8780",345,"you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8781",345,"think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8782",345,"you all the time.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8783",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8784",345,"""Go on,"" said Arthur hoarsely. ""Tell me what I am to do.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8785",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8786",345,"""Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8787",345,"heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8788",345,"the dead--I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8789",345,"follow--strike in God's name, that so all may be well with the dead that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8791",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8792",345,"Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8793",345,"action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8794",345,"his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8795",345,"could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8796",345,"see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8797",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8798",345,"The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8799",345,"came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8800",345,"in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8801",345,"lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8802",345,"never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8803",345,"rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8804",345,"the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8805",345,"face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8806",345,"gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8807",345,"vault.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8808",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8809",345,"And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8810",345,"teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8811",345,"terrible task was over.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8812",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8813",345,"The hammer fell from Arthur's hand. He reeled and would have fallen had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8814",345,"we not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8815",345,"and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8816",345,"on him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8817",345,"considerations he could never have gone through with it. For a few","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8818",345,"minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8819",345,"coffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8820",345,"to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8821",345,"been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8822",345,"strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8823",345,"horror that lay upon it.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8824",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8825",345,"There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8826",345,"and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8827",345,"privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8828",345,"her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8829",345,"there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8830",345,"pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8831",345,"to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8832",345,"sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8833",345,"symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8839",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8840",345,"The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man's hand","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8841",345,"in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8842",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8843",345,"""Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8844",345,"and me peace."" He put his hands on the Professor's shoulder, and laying","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8845",345,"his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8846",345,"unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8847",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8848",345,"""And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8849",345,"she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8850",345,"devil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8851",345,"the devil's Un-Dead. She is God's true dead, whose soul is with Him!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8852",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8853",345,"Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8854",345,"tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8855",345,"of it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8856",345,"garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8857",345,"and gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8858",345,"the door he gave the key to Arthur.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8859",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8860",345,"Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8861",345,"seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8862",345,"gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8863",345,"on one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8864",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8865",345,"Before we moved away Van Helsing said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8866",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8867",345,"""Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8868",345,"to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8869",345,"of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8870",345,"follow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8871",345,"it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8872",345,"of us--is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8873",345,"we not promise to go on to the bitter end?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8874",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8875",345,"Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8877",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8878",345,"""Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8880",345,"know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8881",345,"unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8882",345,"about, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8883",345,"return to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8884",345,"shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8885",345,"Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8907",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8908",345,"When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8909",345,"a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8910",345,"copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker's diary at Whitby. ""Take these,"" he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8911",345,"said, ""and study them well. When I have returned you will be master of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8912",345,"all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8913",345,"them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8914",345,"faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. What","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8915",345,"is here told,"" he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8916",345,"papers as he spoke, ""may be the beginning of the end to you and me and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8917",345,"many another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8919",345,"any way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8920",345,"kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8921",345,"shall go through all these together when we meet."" He then made ready","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8922",345,"for his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8923",345,"took my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8924",345,"the train came in.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8925",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8926",345,"The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8927",345,"platforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8928",345,"guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8929",345,"after a quick glance, said: ""Dr. Seward, is it not?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8930",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8931",345,"""And you are Mrs. Harker!"" I answered at once; whereupon she held out","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8932",345,"her hand.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8933",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8934",345,"""I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but----"" She stopped","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8935",345,"suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8936",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8937",345,"The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8938",345,"was a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8939",345,"typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8940",345,"sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8941",345,"prepared at once for Mrs. Harker.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8942",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8943",345,"In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8944",345,"lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8945",345,"when we entered.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8946",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8947",345,"She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8948",345,"she had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8949",345,"diary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8950",345,"the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8951",345,"me. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8952",345,"opportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8953",345,"what a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Here","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8960",345,"study. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8961",345,"with some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8962",345,"the door, and on his calling out, ""Come in,"" I entered.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8963",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8967",345,"interested.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8969",345,"""I hope I did not keep you waiting,"" I said; ""but I stayed at the door","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8971",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8973",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8974",345,"""Your diary?"" I asked him in surprise.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8975",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8976",345,"""Yes,"" he answered. ""I keep it in this."" As he spoke he laid his hand on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8978",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"8981",345,"""Certainly,"" he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8982",345,"for speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8983",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8984",345,"""The fact is,"" he began awkwardly, ""I only keep my diary in it; and as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8985",345,"it is entirely--almost entirely--about my cases, it may be awkward--that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8986",345,"is, I mean----"" He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8987",345,"embarrassment:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8988",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8989",345,"""You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8990",345,"for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, very","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8991",345,"dear to me.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8992",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8993",345,"To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8994",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8995",345,"""Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8996",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8997",345,"""Why not?"" I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8998",345,"Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"8999",345,"At length he stammered out:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9000",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9001",345,"""You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9002",345,"diary."" Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9003",345,"with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naïveté","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9004",345,"of a child: ""That's quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!"" I could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9005",345,"not but smile, at which he grimaced. ""I gave myself away that time!"" he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9006",345,"said. ""But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9007",345,"past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9008",345,"part of it in case I wanted to look it up?"" By this time my mind was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9009",345,"made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9010",345,"something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9011",345,"I said boldly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9012",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9013",345,"""Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9014",345,"typewriter."" He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9015",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9016",345,"""No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn't let you know that terrible","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9018",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9019",345,"Then it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9020",345,"and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9021",345,"some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9022",345,"the table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9023",345,"followed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9024",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9025",345,"""You do not know me,"" I said. ""When you have read those papers--my own","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9026",345,"diary and my husband's also, which I have typed--you will know me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9027",345,"better. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9028",345,"this cause; but, of course, you do not know me--yet; and I must not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9029",345,"expect you to trust me so far.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9031",345,"He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9032",345,"him. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9033",345,"order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9034",345,"said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9035",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9036",345,"""You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9037",345,"But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9038",345,"ago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I make","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9039",345,"the only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them--the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9040",345,"first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9041",345,"you; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9042",345,"meantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9043",345,"able to understand certain things."" He carried the phonograph himself up","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9044",345,"to my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9045",345,"pleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true love","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9053",345,"thinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9055",345,"I went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker's diary, when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9056",345,"she came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9057",345,"flushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9058",345,"cause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9059",345,"now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9065",345,"than I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9066",345,"cruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9067",345,"It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9076",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9110",345,"placed me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9120",345,"cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9122",345,"the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9123",345,"was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9125",345,"had not known Jonathan's experience in Transylvania I could not have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9126",345,"believed. As it was, I didn't know what to believe, and so got out of my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9127",345,"difficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9128",345,"typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9129",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9130",345,"""Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9131",345,"when he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9132",345,"he arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9133",345,"and I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9134",345,"put in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9135",345,"Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9136",345,"when they come."" He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9137",345,"began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I used","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9138",345,"manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9139",345,"all the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9140",345,"his work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9141",345,"came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9142",345,"whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9143",345,"good men--even if there _are_ monsters in it. Before I left him I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9177",345,"     Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9178",345,"     the Count's hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9179",345,"     from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9180",345,"     relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9181",345,"     if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9182",345,"     Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9183",345,"     collating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9184",345,"     able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9185",345,"     meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9186",345,"     index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9187",345,"     but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9188",345,"     that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9189",345,"     found the dates otherwise....","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9190",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9191",345,"     I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9192",345,"     folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9193",345,"     one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9194",345,"     subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his own","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9195",345,"     accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9196",345,"     knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9197",345,"     confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9198",345,"     not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9199",345,"     his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9200",345,"     brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9201",345,"     those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9202",345,"     Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9203",345,"     his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire's ultimate triumph?","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9204",345,"     Stay; he is himself zoöphagous, and in his wild ravings outside the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9205",345,"     chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of ""master."" This","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9206",345,"     all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9207",345,"     away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9208",345,"     safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9209",345,"     and then--! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9218",345,"thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9220",345,"of the Count's to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9221",345,"with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9222",345,"brought me to his father's house, where they had decided that I must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9223",345,"stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality:","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9226",345,"ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9227",345,"It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9228",345,"seen on the Count's table before I knew of his diabolical plans.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9229",345,"Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9230",345,"with precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9231",345,"might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9232",345,"out. To use an Americanism, he had ""taken no chances,"" and the absolute","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9233",345,"accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9234",345,"logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it:","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9235",345,"""Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9236",345,"Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9237",345,"these I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9238",345,"give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9239",345,"officers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9240",345,"strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9241",345,"tradition; but no one could add to the simple description ""Fifty cases","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9242",345,"of common earth."" I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9243",345,"communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9244",345,"tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9245",345,"the boxes were ""main and mortal heavy,"" and that shifting them was dry","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9246",345,"work. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn't any","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9247",345,"gentleman ""such-like as yourself, squire,"" to show some sort of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9248",345,"appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9249",345,"that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9250",345,"elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9258",345,"arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9262",345,"limited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9270",345,"also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9271",345,"delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9330",345,"Helsing, too, has been quite ""blowing my trumpet,"" as Mr. Morris","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9331",345,"expressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9332",345,"about the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9333",345,"say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9334",345,"had to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9335",345,"came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9336",345,"them in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward's diary that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9337",345,"they had been at Lucy's death--her real death--and that I need not fear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9338",345,"to betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9339",345,"could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9340",345,"and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9341",345,"I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9342",345,"his and turned it over--it does make a pretty good pile--he said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9343",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9344",345,"""Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9345",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9346",345,"I nodded, and he went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9347",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9348",345,"""I don't quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9349",345,"kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9350",345,"I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9351",345,"had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9352",345,"to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy--""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9353",345,"Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9354",345,"the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9355",345,"a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9356",345,"room. I suppose there is something in woman's nature that makes a man","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9357",345,"free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9358",345,"emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9359",345,"Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9360",345,"gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9361",345,"hope he didn't think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9362",345,"afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9363",345,"_know_ he never will--he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9364",345,"could see that his heart was breaking:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9365",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9366",345,"""I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9367",345,"her. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9368",345,"me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9369",345,"had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9370",345,"help in your affliction, won't you let me be of some little service--for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9371",345,"Lucy's sake?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9372",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9373",345,"In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9374",345,"to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9375",345,"vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9376",345,"his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9377",345,"down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9378",345,"pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9379",345,"head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9380",345,"emotion.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9381",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9382",345,"We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9383",345,"smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9384",345,"sorrowing man's head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9385",345,"that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9386",345,"were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9387",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9388",345,"After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9389",345,"apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9390",345,"days and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9391",345,"unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9392",345,"sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9393",345,"whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9394",345,"surrounded, he could speak freely. ""I know now how I suffered,"" he said,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9395",345,"as he dried his eyes, ""but I do not know even yet--and none other can","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9396",345,"ever know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9397",345,"know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9398",345,"now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9399",345,"like a brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear Lucy's sake?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9400",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9401",345,"""For dear Lucy's sake,"" I said as we clasped hands. ""Ay, and for your","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9402",345,"own sake,"" he added, ""for if a man's esteem and gratitude are ever worth","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9403",345,"the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9404",345,"to you a time when you need a man's help, believe me, you will not call","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9405",345,"in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9406",345,"sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9407",345,"will let me know."" He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9408",345,"I felt it would comfort him, so I said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9409",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9410",345,"""I promise.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9411",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9412",345,"As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9413",345,"He turned as he heard my footsteps. ""How is Art?"" he said. Then noticing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9414",345,"my red eyes, he went on: ""Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9415",345,"old fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9416",345,"trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9417",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9418",345,"He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9419",345,"manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9420",345,"how much I knew; so I said to him:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9421",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9422",345,"""I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9423",345,"be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9424",345,"will know, later on, why I speak."" He saw that I was in earnest, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9425",345,"stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9426",345,"but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9427",345,"bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9428",345,"momentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9429",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9430",345,"""Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9431",345,"as ever you live!"" Then he went into the study to his friend.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9432",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9433",345,"""Little girl!""--the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9434",345,"proved himself a friend!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9439",345,"CHAPTER XVIII","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9440",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9441",345,"DR. SEWARD'S DIARY","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9442",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9443",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9444",345,"_30 September._--I got home at five o'clock, and found that Godalming","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9445",345,"and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9446",345,"of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9447",345,"had made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9448",345,"carriers' men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9449",345,"us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9450",345,"have lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. When we had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9451",345,"finished, Mrs. Harker said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9452",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9453",345,"""Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9454",345,"Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9455",345,"interests me so much!"" She looked so appealing and so pretty that I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9456",345,"could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9457",345,"I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9458",345,"lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: ""Why?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9459",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9460",345,"""She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,"" I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9461",345,"answered. ""Oh, very well,"" he said; ""let her come in, by all means; but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9462",345,"just wait a minute till I tidy up the place."" His method of tidying was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9463",345,"peculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9464",345,"before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9465",345,"jealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9466",345,"task, he said cheerfully: ""Let the lady come in,"" and sat down on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9467",345,"edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9468",345,"he could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9469",345,"have some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9470",345,"before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9471",345,"could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9472",345,"came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9473",345,"the respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9474",345,"people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9475",345,"held out her hand.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9476",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9477",345,"""Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,"" said she. ""You see, I know you, for Dr.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9478",345,"Seward has told me of you."" He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9479",345,"over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9480",345,"of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9481",345,"said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9482",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9483",345,"""You're not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can't be,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9484",345,"you know, for she's dead."" Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9485",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9486",345,"""Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9487",345,"saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9488",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9489",345,"""Then what are you doing here?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9490",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9491",345,"""My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9492",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9493",345,"""Then don't stay.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9494",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9495",345,"""But why not?"" I thought that this style of conversation might not be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9496",345,"pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9497",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9498",345,"""How did you know I wanted to marry any one?"" His reply was simply","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9499",345,"contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9500",345,"Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9501",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9502",345,"""What an asinine question!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9503",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9504",345,"""I don't see that at all, Mr. Renfield,"" said Mrs. Harker, at once","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9505",345,"championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9506",345,"he had shown contempt to me:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9507",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9508",345,"""You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9509",345,"loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9510",345,"interest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9511",345,"household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9512",345,"them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9513",345,"effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9514",345,"cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9515",345,"lean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_."" I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9516",345,"positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9517",345,"lunatic--the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9518",345,"with--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9519",345,"gentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker's presence which had touched","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9520",345,"some chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9521",345,"way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9522",345,"power.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9523",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9524",345,"We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9525",345,"quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9526",345,"began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9527",345,"he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9528",345,"completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9529",345,"certain things.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9530",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9531",345,"""Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9532",345,"it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9533",345,"put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9534",345,"perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9535",345,"matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9536",345,"life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9537",345,"take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9538",345,"tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9539",345,"the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9540",345,"blood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, 'For the blood is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9541",345,"the life.' Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9542",345,"vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn't that true,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9543",345,"doctor?"" I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9544",345,"either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9545",345,"his spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9546",345,"saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9547",345,"Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9548",345,"pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: ""Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9549",345,"under auspices pleasanter to yourself,"" to which, to my astonishment, he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9550",345,"replied:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9551",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9552",345,"""Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9553",345,"May He bless and keep you!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9554",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9555",345,"When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9556",345,"me. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9557",345,"ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9558",345,"many a long day.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9559",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9560",345,"Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9561",345,"boy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9562",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9563",345,"""Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9564",345,"here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9565",345,"much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9566",345,"Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9567",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9568",345,"As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9569",345,"diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker's suggestion; at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9570",345,"which the Professor interrupted me:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9571",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9572",345,"""Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man's brain--a brain that a man","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9573",345,"should have were he much gifted--and a woman's heart. The good God","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9574",345,"fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9575",345,"combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9576",345,"to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9577",345,"affair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9578",345,"determined--nay, are we not pledged?--to destroy this monster; but it is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9579",345,"no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9580",345,"in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9581",345,"waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9582",345,"she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9583",345,"think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9584",345,"must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9585",345,"we go alone."" I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9586",345,"had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9587",345,"the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9588",345,"to come on him. ""Oh that we had known it before!"" he said, ""for then we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9589",345,"might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, 'the milk","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9590",345,"that is spilt cries not out afterwards,' as you say. We shall not think","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9591",345,"of that, but go on our way to the end."" Then he fell into a silence that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9592",345,"lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9593",345,"dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9594",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9595",345,"""I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9596",345,"put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9597",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9598",345,"""Not up to this moment, Professor,"" she said impulsively, ""but up to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9599",345,"this morning.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9600",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9601",345,"""But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9602",345,"little things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9603",345,"has told is the worse for it.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9604",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9605",345,"Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9606",345,"said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9607",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9608",345,"""Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9609",345,"is my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9610",345,"present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9611",345,"what is personal. Must it go in?"" The Professor read it over gravely,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9612",345,"and handed it back, saying:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9613",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9614",345,"""It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It can","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9615",345,"but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9616",345,"honour you--as well as more esteem and love."" She took it back with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9617",345,"another blush and a bright smile.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9618",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9619",345,"And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9620",345,"and in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9621",345,"and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o'clock. The rest of us","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9622",345,"have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9623",345,"be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9624",345,"terrible and mysterious enemy.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9630",345,"dinner, which had been at six o'clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9631",345,"board or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9632",345,"which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9633",345,"next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan sat","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9634",345,"next to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9635",345,"Morris--Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9638",345,"""I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9643",345,"something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9644",345,"So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9645",345,"according.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9649",345,"teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9650",345,"peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9651",345,"through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9652",345,"have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. 'See! see!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9653",345,"I prove; I prove.' Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know--nay,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9654",345,"had I even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9655",345,"us who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9656",345,"poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The _nosferatu_ do not die","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9657",345,"like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9658",345,"stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9659",345,"amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9660",345,"cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9661",345,"still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9662",345,"divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9663",345,"for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9664",345,"callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9665",345,"at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9666",345,"can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9667",345,"thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9668",345,"the bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9669",345,"small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9670",345,"begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9671",345,"found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9672",345,"task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9673",345,"shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9674",345,"where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9675",345,"mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9676",345,"become foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9677",345,"preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9678",345,"ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again?","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9679",345,"We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9680",345,"sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9681",345,"to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9682",345,"but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9683",345,"song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9684",345,"young. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9687",345,"Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9688",345,"much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9689",345,"saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9690",345,"strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man's hand can speak for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9691",345,"itself; it does not even need a woman's love to hear its music.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9692",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9701",345,"reason.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9702",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9703",345,"Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9704",345,"golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9705",345,"his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9706",345,"his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9707",345,"solemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9708",345,"occur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9709",345,"went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9710",345,"had begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9711",345,"as any other transaction of life:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9712",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9713",345,"""Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9714",345,"without strength. We have on our side power of combination--a power","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9715",345,"denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9716",345,"act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9717",345,"In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9718",345,"free to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9719",345,"achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9720",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9721",345,"""Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9722",345,"restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9723",345,"limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9724",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9725",345,"""All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9726",345,"at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9727",345,"of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9728",345,"first place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9729",345,"secondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9730",345,"superstition--are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9731",345,"others--though not, alas! for us--on them? A year ago which of us would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9732",345,"have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9733",345,"sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9734",345,"that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9735",345,"vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9736",345,"moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9737",345,"that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9738",345,"all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9739",345,"far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9740",345,"this day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9741",345,"devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9742",345,"have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9743",345,"beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9744",345,"experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9745",345,"time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9746",345,"living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9747",345,"younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9748",345,"they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9749",345,"cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9750",345,"Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9751",345,"He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9752",345,"Jonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand--witness again","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9753",345,"Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9754",345,"from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9755",345,"from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9756",345,"bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9757",345,"saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9758",345,"the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create--that noble","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9759",345,"ship's captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9760",345,"he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9761",345,"come on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9762",345,"sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we ourselves saw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9763",345,"Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9764",345,"tomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9765",345,"into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9766",345,"fire--solder you call it. He can see in the dark--no small power this,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9767",345,"in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9768",345,"through. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9769",345,"more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9770",345,"He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9771",345,"some of nature's laws--why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9772",345,"first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9773",345,"though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9774",345,"that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9775",345,"can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9776",345,"bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9777",345,"These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9778",345,"inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9779",345,"have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9780",345,"unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9781",345,"Whitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9782",345,"said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9783",345,"of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9784",345,"power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9785",345,"symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9786",345,"them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9787",345,"silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9788",345,"lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9789",345,"coffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9790",345,"coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9791",345,"him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9792",345,"We have seen it with our eyes.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9793",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9794",345,"""Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9795",345,"him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9796",345,"clever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9797",345,"make his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9798",345,"has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9799",345,"name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9800",345,"Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9801",345,"and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9802",345,"cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the 'land beyond the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9803",345,"forest.' That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9804",345,"grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9805",345,"Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9806",345,"were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9807",345,"learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9808",345,"Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9817",345,"Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9818",345,"and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9821",345,"""And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9822",345,"proceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9823",345,"that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9824",345,"were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9825",345,"have been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9826",345,"ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9827",345,"where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9828",345,"latter, we must trace----""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9829",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9830",345,"Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9831",345,"the sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9832",345,"bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9833",345,"far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9834",345,"out. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9835",345,"window and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris's voice","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9836",345,"without:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9837",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9838",345,"""Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9839",345,"it."" A minute later he came in and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9840",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9841",345,"""It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9842",345,"Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9843",345,"the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9844",345,"and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9845",345,"brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9846",345,"have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9847",345,"seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9851",345,"""I don't know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood."" Without","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9852",345,"saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9857",345,"speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9858",345,"Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9859",345,"noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9863",345,"no more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9871",345,"minds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9880",345,"I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9881",345,"close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9882",345,"appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9883",345,"me out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9884",345,"with means to get into the house.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9894",345,"urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9895",345,"him at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9896",345,"I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9897",345,"morning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9898",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9899",345,"""He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don't","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9900",345,"know but what, if you don't see him soon, he will have one of his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9901",345,"violent fits."" I knew the man would not have said this without some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9902",345,"cause, so I said: ""All right; I'll go now""; and I asked the others to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9906",345,"diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9907",345,"case. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9908",345,"disturbed.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"9912",345,"""Me too?"" said Quincey Morris. ""May I come?"" said Harker. I nodded, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9913",345,"we all went down the passage together.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9914",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9915",345,"We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9916",345,"rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9917",345,"unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9918",345,"met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9919",345,"prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9920",345,"none of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9921",345,"at once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9922",345,"with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9923",345,"existing sanity. ""I appeal to your friends,"" he said, ""they will,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9924",345,"perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9925",345,"not introduced me."" I was so much astonished, that the oddness of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9926",345,"introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9927",345,"besides, there was a certain dignity in the man's manner, so much of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9928",345,"the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: ""Lord","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9929",345,"Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9930",345,"Renfield."" He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9931",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9932",345,"""Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9933",345,"Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9934",345,"more. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9935",345,"youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9936",345,"patronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9937",345,"state. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9938",345,"far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9939",345,"alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9940",345,"vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9941",345,"place as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9942",345,"meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9943",345,"conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9944",345,"by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9945",345,"conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9946",345,"one of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9947",345,"the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9948",345,"places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9949",345,"least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9950",345,"And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9951",345,"well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9952",345,"be considered as under exceptional circumstances."" He made this last","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9953",345,"appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9954",345,"charm.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9955",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9956",345,"I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9957",345,"conviction, despite my knowledge of the man's character and history,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9958",345,"that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9959",345,"tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9960",345,"necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9961",345,"better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9962",345,"I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9963",345,"So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9964",345,"to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9965",345,"in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9966",345,"meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9967",345,"quickly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9968",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9969",345,"""But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9970",345,"go at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may. Time","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9971",345,"presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9972",345,"the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9973",345,"before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9974",345,"momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment."" He looked at me keenly, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9975",345,"seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9976",345,"them closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9977",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9978",345,"""Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9979",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9980",345,"""You have,"" I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9981",345,"There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9982",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9983",345,"""Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9984",345,"this concession--boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9985",345,"in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9986",345,"am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9987",345,"assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9988",345,"unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9989",345,"sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9990",345,"animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9991",345,"your friends."" Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9992",345,"conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9993",345,"but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9994",345,"him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9995",345,"all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9996",345,"him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9997",345,"with the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9998",345,"which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"9999",345,"afterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10000",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10001",345,"""Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10002",345,"to-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10003",345,"without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--Dr.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10004",345,"Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10005",345,"privilege you seek."" He shook his head sadly, and with a look of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10006",345,"poignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10007",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10008",345,"""Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10009",345,"highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10010",345,"reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10011",345,"you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10012",345,"you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10013",345,"we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10014",345,"us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish."" He still shook","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10015",345,"his head as he said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10016",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10017",345,"""Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10018",345,"if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10019",345,"own master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10020",345,"refused, the responsibility does not rest with me."" I thought it was now","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10021",345,"time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10022",345,"towards the door, simply saying:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10023",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10024",345,"""Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10025",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10026",345,"As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10027",345,"moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10028",345,"about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10029",345,"groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10030",345,"petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10031",345,"emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10032",345,"relations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10033",345,"and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10034",345,"fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10035",345,"efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10036",345,"constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10037",345,"which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10038",345,"wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10039",345,"sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10040",345,"for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10041",345,"quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10042",345,"his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10043",345,"torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10044",345,"whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10045",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10046",345,"""Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10047",345,"of this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10048",345,"send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10049",345,"strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10050",345,"out of this. You don't know what you do by keeping me here. I am","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10051",345,"speaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. You don't know","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10055",345,"of this and save my soul from guilt! Can't you hear me, man? Can't you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10056",345,"understand? Will you never learn? Don't you know that I am sane and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10057",345,"earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10067",345,"without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10085",345,"_1 October, 5 a. m._--I went with the party to the search with an easy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10086",345,"mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10087",345,"so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10088",345,"Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10089",345,"all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10090",345,"brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10091",345,"that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10092",345,"that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10093",345,"little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10094",345,"room we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10095",345,"to Dr. Seward:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10096",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10097",345,"""Say, Jack, if that man wasn't attempting a bluff, he is about the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10098",345,"sanest lunatic I ever saw. I'm not sure, but I believe that he had some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10099",345,"serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10100",345,"chance."" Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10101",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10102",345,"""Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I'm glad of it,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10103",345,"for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10104",345,"hysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10105",345,"our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10106",345,"All is best as they are."" Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10107",345,"dreamy kind of way:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10108",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10109",345,"""I don't know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10110",345,"ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10111",345,"seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10112",345,"afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can't forget how","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10113",345,"he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10114",345,"throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count 'lord and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10115",345,"master,' and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10116",345,"That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10117",345,"him, so I suppose he isn't above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10118",345,"certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10119",345,"best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10120",345,"help to unnerve a man."" The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10121",345,"on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10122",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10123",345,"""Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10124",345,"and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10125",345,"hope for, except the pity of the good God?"" Lord Godalming had slipped","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10126",345,"away for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10127",345,"whistle, as he remarked:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10128",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10129",345,"""That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I've got an antidote on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10130",345,"call."" Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10131",345,"to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10132",345,"out. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10133",345,"a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10134",345,"little groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10135",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10136",345,"""My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10137",345,"many kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10138",345,"strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10139",345,"of the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10140",345,"amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10141",345,"in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10142",345,"as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10143",345,"touch. Keep this near your heart""--as he spoke he lifted a little silver","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10144",345,"crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--""put these","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10145",345,"flowers round your neck""--here he handed to me a wreath of withered","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10146",345,"garlic blossoms--""for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10147",345,"knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10148",345,"fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10149",345,"which we must not desecrate needless."" This was a portion of Sacred","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10150",345,"Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10151",345,"was similarly equipped. ""Now,"" he said, ""friend John, where are the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10152",345,"skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10153",345,"by the window, as before at Miss Lucy's.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10154",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10155",345,"Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10156",345,"surgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; after","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10157",345,"a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10158",345,"clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10159",345,"it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10160",345,"Dr. Seward's diary of the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb; I fancy that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10161",345,"the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10162",345,"shrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10163",345,"into the open door.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10164",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10165",345,"""_In manus tuas, Domine!_"" he said, crossing himself as he passed over","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10166",345,"the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10167",345,"lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10168",345,"Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10169",345,"from within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10170",345,"lamps and proceeded on our search.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10171",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10172",345,"The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10173",345,"rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10174",345,"shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10175",345,"was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10176",345,"powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10177",345,"experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10178",345,"for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10179",345,"sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10180",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10181",345,"The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10182",345,"deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10183",345,"my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10184",345,"walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10185",345,"spider's webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10186",345,"tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10187",345,"hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. They","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10188",345,"had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10189",345,"in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10190",345,"lifted them. He turned to me and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10191",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10192",345,"""You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you know","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10193",345,"it at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?"" I had an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10194",345,"idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10195",345,"get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10196",345,"found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10197",345,"""This is the spot,"" said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10198",345,"map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10199",345,"regarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10200",345,"bunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10201",345,"as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10202",345,"through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10203",345,"encountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10204",345,"quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10205",345,"his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10206",345,"a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10207",345,"close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10208",345,"an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10209",345,"air. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10210",345,"alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10211",345,"pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10212",345,"become itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10213",345,"exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10214",345,"intensified its loathsomeness.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10215",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10216",345,"Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10217",345,"enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10218",345,"terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10219",345,"above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10220",345,"consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10221",345,"work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10222",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10223",345,"We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10224",345,"began:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10225",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10226",345,"""The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10227",345,"examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10228",345,"clue as to what has become of the rest."" A glance was sufficient to show","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10229",345,"how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10230",345,"no mistaking them.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10231",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10232",345,"There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10233",345,"for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10234",345,"door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10235",345,"heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10236",345,"see the high lights of the Count's evil face, the ridge of the nose, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10237",345,"red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10238",345,"as Lord Godalming said, ""I thought I saw a face, but it was only the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10239",345,"shadows,"" and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10240",345,"and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10241",345,"were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10242",345,"walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10243",345,"took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10244",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10245",345,"A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10246",345,"he was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10247",345,"undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10248",345,"of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10249",345,"back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10250",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10251",345,"For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10252",345,"seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10253",345,"iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10254",345,"and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10255",345,"huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10256",345,"whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10257",345,"from behind Dr. Seward's house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10258",345,"minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10259",345,"Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10260",345,"noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10261",345,"taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10262",345,"elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10263",345,"swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10264",345,"moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10265",345,"like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10266",345,"threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10267",345,"their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10268",345,"multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10269",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10270",345,"Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10271",345,"on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10272",345,"recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10273",345,"him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10274",345,"dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10275",345,"ere the whole mass had vanished.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10276",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10277",345,"With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10278",345,"the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10279",345,"their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10280",345,"the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10281",345,"Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10282",345,"the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10283",345,"in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10284",345,"slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10285",345,"of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10286",345,"resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10287",345,"bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10303",345,"accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10304",345,"troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10305",345,"smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10306",345,"learned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10307",345,"beasts which are to the Count's command are yet themselves not amenable","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10308",345,"to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10310",345,"to that poor mother's cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10313",345,"his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10314",345,"So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10315",345,"to cry 'check' in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10316",345,"stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10317",345,"and we have reason to be content with our first night's work. It may be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10318",345,"ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10322",345,"was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10323",345,"from Renfield's room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10327",345,"softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10328",345,"usual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10329",345,"thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10330",345,"deliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10331",345,"think so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10332",345,"settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10333",345,"to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10334",345,"suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10335",345,"sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10336",345,"is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10347",345,"till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10348",345,"three times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10350",345,"blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. She","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10351",345,"complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10361",345,"_1 October._--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10362",345,"walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10363",345,"is quite evident that last night's work has helped to take some of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10364",345,"brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10365",345,"night he suddenly said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10366",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10367",345,"""Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10368",345,"this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10369",345,"be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10370",345,"and reason so sound."" I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10371",345,"that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10372",345,"keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10373",345,"instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10374",345,"getting any false impression from my patient. ""But,"" he answered, ""I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10375",345,"want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10376",345,"things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10377",345,"he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10378",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10379",345,"""Excuse me,"" I said, ""but the answer is here."" I laid my hand on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10380",345,"type-written matter. ""When our sane and learned lunatic made that very","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10381",345,"statement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10382",345,"nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10383",345,"Harker entered the room."" Van Helsing smiled in turn. ""Good!"" he said.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10384",345,"""Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10385",345,"is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10386",345,"such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10387",345,"folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10388",345,"Who knows?"" I went on with my work, and before long was through that in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10389",345,"hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10390",345,"Van Helsing back in the study. ""Do I interrupt?"" he asked politely as he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10391",345,"stood at the door.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10392",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10393",345,"""Not at all,"" I answered. ""Come in. My work is finished, and I am free.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10394",345,"I can go with you now, if you like.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10395",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10402",345,"his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10403",345,"discontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10404",345,"measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. ""Don't","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10405",345,"you know me?"" I asked. His answer was not reassuring: ""I know you well","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10406",345,"enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10407",345,"and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10408",345,"Dutchmen!"" Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10409",345,"sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10410",345,"all. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10411",345,"clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10412",345,"happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10413",345,"rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10414",345,"worried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10416",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10417",345,"""I agree with you with all my heart,"" I answered earnestly, for I did","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10419",345,"Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10420",345,"been in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10433",345,"manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10434",345,"morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10435",345,"Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10436",345,"out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10437",345,"what had happened in the visit to the Count's house. And yet he must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10438",345,"have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10439",345,"must have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10440",345,"it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10441",345,"I acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10442",345,"crying like a silly fool, when I _know_ it comes from my husband's great","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10443",345,"love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10444",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10448",345,"feared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10453",345,"Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10454",345,"me to. I didn't feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10455",345,"kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10456",345,"see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10457",345,"pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10458",345,"seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10459",345,"is most to be deplored. If I hadn't gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10460",345,"Lucy would be with us now. She hadn't taken to visiting the churchyard","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10461",345,"till I came, and if she hadn't come there in the day-time with me she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10462",345,"wouldn't have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn't gone there at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10463",345,"night and asleep, that monster couldn't have destroyed her as he did.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10464",345,"Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder what","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10465",345,"has come over me to-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10466",345,"that I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10467",345,"own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear--the dear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10468",345,"fellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10469",345,"feel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessons","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10470",345,"that we poor women have to learn....","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10471",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10472",345,"I can't quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10473",345,"the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10474",345,"on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield's room, which is somewhere","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10475",345,"under this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10476",345,"profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10477",345,"All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10478",345,"seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10479",345,"stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10480",345,"streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10481",345,"across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10482",345,"vitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10483",345,"have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10484",345,"creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10485",345,"and looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10486",345,"close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10487",345,"wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10488",345,"more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10489",345,"I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10490",345,"his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10491",345,"attendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10492",345,"bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10493",345,"I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10494",345,"fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10495",345,"morning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10496",345,"little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10497",345,"bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10498",345,"the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10499",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10500",345,"I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10501",345,"was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10502",345,"hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10503",345,"usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10504",345,"upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10505",345,"clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10506",345,"around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10507",345,"came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10508",345,"grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10509",345,"had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10510",345,"make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10511",345,"limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10512",345,"my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10513",345,"tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10514",345,"mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10515",345,"could see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10516",345,"water--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10517",345,"the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10518",345,"concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10519",345,"of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10520",345,"began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10521",345,"whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words ""a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10522",345,"pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night."" Was it indeed some such","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10523",345,"spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10524",345,"composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10525",345,"red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10526",345,"looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10527",345,"two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10528",345,"when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10529",345,"Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10530",345,"had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10531",345,"in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10532",345,"black darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10533",345,"show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10534",345,"careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one's reason if there were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10535",345,"too much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10536",345,"something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10537",345,"them. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10538",345,"fears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10539",345,"not, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10540",345,"cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night's sleep. Last","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10541",345,"night tired me more than if I had not slept at all.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10545",345,"_2 October 10 p. m._--Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10546",345,"slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10547",345,"sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10548",345,"spiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10549",345,"In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10550",345,"very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10551",345,"me. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. This","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10552",345,"is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10553",345,"miserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out till","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10554",345,"dinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10555",345,"them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10556",345,"tired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10557",345,"together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10558",345,"of what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10559",345,"manner that he had something important to communicate. I was not so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10560",345,"sleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10561",345,"give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10562",345,"before. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10563",345,"me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10564",345,"have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10565",345,"I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10566",345,"comes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10567",345,"power of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10577",345,"_1 October, evening._--I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10578",345,"Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10579",345,"very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10580",345,"proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10581",345,"learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10582",345,"was only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10583",345,"responsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10584",345,"Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10585",345,"saucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10586",345,"type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10587",345,"about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog's-eared","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10588",345,"notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10589",345,"seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10590",345,"half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10591",345,"were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10592",345,"197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10593",345,"deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10594",345,"scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10595",345,"chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10596",345,"fully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10597",345,"he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was now","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10598",345,"fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10599",345,"shore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10600",345,"be left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the City itself and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10601",345,"very heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went back","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10602",345,"to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10603",345,"been taken from Carfax.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10604",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10605",345,"He replied:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10606",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10607",345,"""Well, guv'nor, you've treated me wery 'an'some""--I had given him half a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10608",345,"sovereign--""an' I'll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10609",345,"Bloxam say four nights ago in the 'Are an' 'Ounds, in Pincher's Alley,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10610",345,"as 'ow he an' his mate 'ad 'ad a rare dusty job in a old 'ouse at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10611",345,"Purfect. There ain't a-many such jobs as this 'ere, an' I'm thinkin'","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10612",345,"that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut."" I asked if he could tell me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10613",345,"where to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10614",345,"would be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10615",345,"of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10616",345,"then and there. At the door he stopped, and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10617",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10618",345,"""Look 'ere, guv'nor, there ain't no sense in me a-keepin' you 'ere. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10619",345,"may find Sam soon, or I mayn't; but anyhow he ain't like to be in a way","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10620",345,"to tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10621",345,"If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10622",345,"it, I'll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. But","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10623",345,"ye'd better be up arter 'im soon in the mornin', or maybe ye won't ketch","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10624",345,"'im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10625",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10626",345,"This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10627",345,"buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10628",345,"came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10629",345,"again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10630",345,"to home. We're on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10631",345,"Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10632",345,"though she had been crying. Poor dear, I've no doubt it frets her to be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10633",345,"kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10634",345,"others. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10635",345,"worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10636",345,"were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10637",345,"business. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10638",345,"must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10639",345,"circumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10640",345,"herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10641",345,"Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10642",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10645",345,"_2 October, evening._--A long and trying and exciting day. By the first","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10646",345,"post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10647",345,"which was written with a carpenter's pencil in a sprawling hand:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10648",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10649",345,"""Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10650",345,"the depite.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10651",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10652",345,"I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10653",345,"and sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10654",345,"but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10655",345,"her going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10656",345,"with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10657",345,"in ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10658",345,"was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10659",345,"have found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10660",345,"difficulty, Potter's Court. Mr. Smollet's spelling misled me, as I asked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10661",345,"for Poter's Court instead of Potter's Court. However, when I had found","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10662",345,"the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran's lodging-house.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10663",345,"When I asked the man who came to the door for the ""depite,"" he shook his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10664",345,"head, and said: ""I dunno 'im. There ain't no such a person 'ere; I never","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10665",345,"'eard of 'im in all my bloomin' days. Don't believe there ain't nobody","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10666",345,"of that kind livin' ere or anywheres."" I took out Smollet's letter, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10667",345,"as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10668",345,"of the court might guide me. ""What are you?"" I asked.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10669",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10670",345,"""I'm the depity,"" he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10671",345,"track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10672",345,"deputy's knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10673",345,"had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10674",345,"Corcoran's, had left for his work at Poplar at five o'clock that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10675",345,"morning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10676",345,"he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a ""new-fangled ware'us"";","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10677",345,"and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10678",345,"o'clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10679",345,"I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10680",345,"of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10681",345,"new ""cold storage"" building; and as this suited the condition of a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10682",345,"""new-fangled ware'us,"" I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10683",345,"gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10684",345,"coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10685",345,"suggesting that I was willing to pay his day's wages to his foreman for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10686",345,"the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10687",345,"a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10688",345,"promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10689",345,"that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10690",345,"and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--""main","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10691",345,"heavy ones""--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10692",345,"asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10693",345,"which he replied:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10694",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10695",345,"""Well, guv'nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10696",345,"big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10746",345,"find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10747",345,"off for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Count","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10748",345,"could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10749",345,"precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10750",345,"distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10751",345,"unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10752",345,"westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10753",345,"described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10754",345,"arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10755",345,"untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10756",345,"up. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10757",345,"had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10758",345,"a large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10759",345,"roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10760",345,"Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10761",345,"whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10762",345,"been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10763",345,"given some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10764",345,"experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10765",345,"but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10766",345,"discovered of gaining access to the house.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10767",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10768",345,"There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10769",345,"nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10770",345,"could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10771",345,"Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10772",345,"grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10773",345,"about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10774",345,"taken, but he couldn't say from whom. He told me, however, that up to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10775",345,"very lately there had been a notice-board of ""For Sale"" up, and that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10776",345,"perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10777",345,"something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10778",345,"the board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10779",345,"or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10780",345,"away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10781",345,"did not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, &","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10782",345,"Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10783",345,"Sackville Street.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10784",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10785",345,"The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10786",345,"uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10787",345,"Piccadilly house--which throughout our interview he called a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10788",345,"""mansion""--was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10789",345,"asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10790",345,"paused a few seconds before replying:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10791",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10792",345,"""It is sold, sir.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10793",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10794",345,"""Pardon me,"" I said, with equal politeness, ""but I have a special reason","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10795",345,"for wishing to know who purchased it.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10796",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10797",345,"Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. ""It is sold,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10798",345,"sir,"" was again his laconic reply.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10799",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10800",345,"""Surely,"" I said, ""you do not mind letting me know so much.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10801",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10802",345,"""But I do mind,"" he answered. ""The affairs of their clients are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10803",345,"absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy."" This was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10804",345,"manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10805",345,"him. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10806",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10807",345,"""Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10808",345,"confidence. I am myself a professional man."" Here I handed him my card.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10809",345,"""In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10810",345,"Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10811",345,"he understood, lately for sale."" These words put a different complexion","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10812",345,"on affairs. He said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10813",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10814",345,"""I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10815",345,"I like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10816",345,"renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10817",345,"Holmwood. If you will let me have his lordship's address I will consult","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10818",345,"the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10819",345,"lordship by to-night's post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10820",345,"deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10821",345,"lordship.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10822",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10823",345,"I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10824",345,"gave the address at Dr. Seward's and came away. It was now dark, and I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10825",345,"was tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the Aërated Bread Company","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10826",345,"and came down to Purfleet by the next train.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10827",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10828",345,"I found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10829",345,"made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10830",345,"think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10831",345,"inquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10832",345,"our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10833",345,"confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10834",345,"keeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10835",345,"else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10836",345,"any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10837",345,"made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10838",345,"knowledge would be torture to her.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10839",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10840",345,"I could not tell the others of the day's discovery till we were alone;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10841",345,"so after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances even","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10842",345,"amongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10843",345,"The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10844",345,"as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10845",345,"came away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10846",345,"difference between us.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10847",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10848",345,"When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10849",345,"the study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10850",345,"it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10851",345,"information; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10852",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10853",345,"""This has been a great day's work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10854",345,"the track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10855",345,"our work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10856",345,"until we find them. Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10857",345,"wretch to his real death."" We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10858",345,"Morris spoke:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10859",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10860",345,"""Say! how are we going to get into that house?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10861",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10862",345,"""We got into the other,"" answered Lord Godalming quickly.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10863",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10864",345,"""But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10865",345,"and a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10866",345,"commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don't","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10867",345,"see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10868",345,"of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10869",345,"morning."" Lord Godalming's brows contracted, and he stood up and walked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10870",345,"about the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10871",345,"another of us:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10872",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10873",345,"""Quincey's head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10874",345,"got off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand--unless we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10875",345,"can find the Count's key basket.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10876",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10877",345,"As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10878",345,"least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell's,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10879",345,"we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a good","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10880",345,"while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10881",345,"bearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10882",345,"moment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10883",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10884",345,"Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10885",345,"forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10886",345,"in her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10887",345,"did this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10888",345,"herself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10889",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10890",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10891",345,"_Dr. Seward's Diary._","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10892",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10893",345,"_1 October._--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10894",345,"rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10895",345,"always mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10896",345,"than interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10897",345,"repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10898",345,"He was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. He did not really","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10899",345,"care for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10900",345,"looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10901",345,"thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10902",345,"him:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10903",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10904",345,"""What about the flies these times?"" He smiled on me in quite a superior","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10905",345,"sort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10906",345,"he answered me:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10907",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10908",345,"""The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10909",345,"of the aërial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10910",345,"when they typified the soul as a butterfly!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10911",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10912",345,"I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10913",345,"quickly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10914",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10915",345,"""Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?"" His madness foiled his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10916",345,"reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10917",345,"with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10918",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10919",345,"""Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want."" Here he brightened","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10920",345,"up; ""I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10921",345,"have all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10922",345,"study zoöphagy!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10923",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10924",345,"This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10925",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10926",345,"""Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?"" He smiled with an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10927",345,"ineffably benign superiority.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10928",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10929",345,"""Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10930",345,"Deity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10931",345,"may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10932",345,"purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10933",345,"spiritually!"" This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10934",345,"Enoch's appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10935",345,"that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10936",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10937",345,"""And why with Enoch?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10938",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10939",345,"""Because he walked with God."" I could not see the analogy, but did not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10940",345,"like to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10941",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10942",345,"""So you don't care about life and you don't want souls. Why not?"" I put","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10943",345,"my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10944",345,"The effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10945",345,"old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10946",345,"he replied:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10947",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10948",345,"""I don't want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don't. I couldn't use them if","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10949",345,"I had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn't eat them","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10950",345,"or----"" He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10951",345,"face, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. ""And doctor, as to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10952",345,"life, what is it after all? When you've got all you require, and you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10953",345,"know that you will never want, that is all. I have friends--good","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10954",345,"friends--like you, Dr. Seward""; this was said with a leer of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10955",345,"inexpressible cunning. ""I know that I shall never lack the means of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10956",345,"life!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10957",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10958",345,"I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10959",345,"antagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10960",345,"he--a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10961",345,"was useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10962",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10963",345,"Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10964",345,"without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10965",345,"that I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10966",345,"to help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10967",345,"Lord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10968",345,"record prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10969",345,"knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10970",345,"to be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10971",345,"me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10972",345,"might not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10973",345,"might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10974",345,"alone.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10975",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10976",345,"I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10977",345,"which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10978",345,"came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10979",345,"lips:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10980",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10981",345,"""What about souls?"" It was evident then that my surmise had been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10982",345,"correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10983",345,"lunatic. I determined to have the matter out. ""What about them","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10984",345,"yourself?"" I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10985",345,"him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10986",345,"an answer.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10987",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10988",345,"""I don't want any souls!"" he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10989",345,"matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it--to ""be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10990",345,"cruel only to be kind."" So I said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10991",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10992",345,"""You like life, and you want life?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"10995",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10996",345,"""But,"" I asked, ""how are we to get the life without getting the soul","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10997",345,"also?"" This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10998",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"10999",345,"""A nice time you'll have some time when you're flying out there, with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11000",345,"the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11001",345,"and twittering and miauing all round you. You've got their lives, you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11002",345,"know, and you must put up with their souls!"" Something seemed to affect","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11003",345,"his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11004",345,"screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11005",345,"soaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11006",345,"me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11007",345,"though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11008",345,"was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11009",345,"and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11010",345,"to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11011",345,"go with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11012",345,"speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11013",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11014",345,"""Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?"" He seemed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11015",345,"wake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11016",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11017",345,"""Not much! flies are poor things, after all!"" After a pause he added,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11018",345,"""But I don't want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11019",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11020",345,"""Or spiders?"" I went on.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11021",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11022",345,"""Blow spiders! What's the use of spiders? There isn't anything in them","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11023",345,"to eat or""--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11025",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11026",345,"""So, so!"" I thought to myself, ""this is the second time he has suddenly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11027",345,"stopped at the word 'drink'; what does it mean?"" Renfield seemed himself","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11028",345,"aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11029",345,"my attention from it:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11030",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11031",345,"""I don't take any stock at all in such matters. 'Rats and mice and such","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11033",345,"might be called. I'm past all that sort of nonsense. You might as well","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11034",345,"ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11040",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11041",345,"""What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!"" He was getting too wide","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11042",345,"awake, so I thought I would press him hard. ""I wonder,"" I said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11043",345,"reflectively, ""what an elephant's soul is like!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11044",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11045",345,"The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11047",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11048",345,"""I don't want an elephant's soul, or any soul at all!"" he said. For a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11049",345,"few moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11050",345,"his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. ""To","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11051",345,"hell with you and your souls!"" he shouted. ""Why do you plague me about","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11052",345,"souls? Haven't I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11053",345,"without thinking of souls!"" He looked so hostile that I thought he was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11054",345,"in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11055",345,"however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11056",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11057",345,"""Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11058",345,"worried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11059",345,"problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11060",345,"tolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11061",345,"want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11062",345,"sure you will understand!"" He had evidently self-control; so when the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11063",345,"attendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11064",345,"watched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11065",345,"dignity and sweetness:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11066",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11067",345,"""Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11068",345,"I am very, very grateful to you!"" I thought it well to leave him in this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11069",345,"mood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11084",345,"that he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence--the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11097",345,"we heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11098",345,"which now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11099",345,"he had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11100",345,"autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talk","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11101",345,"of the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11102",345,"went on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11103",345,"got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note-book. We had to come","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11135",345,"make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield's room,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11136",345,"and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11138",345,"in the study--Mrs. Harker having gone to bed--we discussed the attempts","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11148",345,"if that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11149",345,"something about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11150",345,"he had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having ""dozed"" for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11195",345,"_3 October._--Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11196",345,"as I can remember it, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11197",345,"can recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11198",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11199",345,"When I came to Renfield's room I found him lying on the floor on his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11200",345,"left side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11201",345,"became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11202",345,"there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11203",345,"which marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11204",345,"that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11205",345,"floor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11206",345,"originated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11207",345,"we turned him over:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11208",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11209",345,"""I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11210",345,"the whole side of his face are paralysed."" How such a thing could have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11211",345,"happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11212",345,"bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11213",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11214",345,"""I can't understand the two things. He could mark his face like that by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11215",345,"beating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11216",345,"Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11217",345,"might have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11218",345,"kink. But for the life of me I can't imagine how the two things","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11219",345,"occurred. If his back was broke, he couldn't beat his head; and if his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11220",345,"face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11221",345,"it."" I said to him:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11222",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11223",345,"""Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11224",345,"him without an instant's delay."" The man ran off, and within a few","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11225",345,"minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11226",345,"he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11227",345,"then turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11228",345,"said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11229",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11230",345,"""Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11236",345,"extraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11237",345,"evidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11240",345,"""Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11247",345,"The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11248",345,"The wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11249",345,"fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11250",345,"Professor thought a moment and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11251",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11252",345,"""We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11253",345,"as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11254",345,"his injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11255",345,"brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11256",345,"too late."" As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11257",345,"went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11258",345,"Quincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11259",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11260",345,"""I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11261",345,"So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11262",345,"are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11263",345,"these times. I've been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11264",345,"as they have been. We'll have to look back--and forward a little more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11265",345,"than we have done. May we come in?"" I nodded, and held the door open","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11266",345,"till they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11267",345,"attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11268",345,"floor, he said softly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11269",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11270",345,"""My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!"" I told him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11271",345,"briefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11272",345,"the operation--for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11273",345,"down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11274",345,"in patience.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11275",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11276",345,"""We shall wait,"" said Van Helsing, ""just long enough to fix the best","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11277",345,"spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11278",345,"the blood clot; for it is evident that the hæmorrhage is increasing.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11279",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11280",345,"The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11281",345,"horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing's face I gathered","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11282",345,"that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11283",345,"the words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11284",345,"but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11285",345,"who have heard the death-watch. The poor man's breathing came in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11286",345,"uncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11287",345,"and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11288",345,"would relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11289",345,"beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11290",345,"hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11291",345,"temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11292",345,"agonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11293",345,"their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11294",345,"torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11295",345,"some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11296",345,"it.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11297",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11298",345,"At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11299",345,"sinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11300",345,"and caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11301",345,"spoke:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11302",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11303",345,"""There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11304",345,"been thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11305",345,"We shall operate just above the ear.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11306",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11307",345,"Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11308",345,"breathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11309",345,"prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11310",345,"Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11311",345,"This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11312",345,"surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11313",345,"convulsively, and as he did so, said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11314",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11315",345,"""I'll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11316",345,"have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11317",345,"move. What's wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11318",345,"dreadfully."" He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11319",345,"eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11320",345,"Helsing said in a quiet grave tone:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11321",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11322",345,"""Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield."" As he heard the voice his face","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11323",345,"brightened, through its mutilation, and he said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11324",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11325",345,"""That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11326",345,"water, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed""--he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11327",345,"stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey--""The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11328",345,"brandy--it is in my study--quick!"" He flew and returned with a glass,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11329",345,"the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11330",345,"lips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11331",345,"injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11332",345,"conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11333",345,"shall never forget, and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11334",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11335",345,"""I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11336",345,"Then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11337",345,"figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11338",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11339",345,"""If I were not sure already, I would know from them."" For an instant his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11340",345,"eyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11341",345,"bringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11342",345,"hurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11343",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11344",345,"""Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11345",345,"and then I must go back to death--or worse! Wet my lips with brandy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11346",345,"again. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11347",345,"crushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11348",345,"me, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn't speak then, for I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11349",345,"felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11350",345,"I am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11351",345,"me; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11352",345,"seemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11353",345,"dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!"" As he spoke, Van","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11354",345,"Helsing's eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11355",345,"gripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11356",345,"and said: ""Go on,"" in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11357",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11358",345,"""He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11359",345,"but he was solid then--not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11360",345,"man's when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11361",345,"teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11362",345,"of trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn't ask him to come in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11363",345,"at first, though I knew he wanted to--just as he had wanted all along.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11364",345,"Then he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them."" He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11365",345,"was interrupted by a word from the Professor:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11366",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11367",345,"""How?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11368",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11369",345,"""By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11370",345,"sun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11371",345,"wings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11372",345,"backs."" Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11373",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11374",345,"""The _Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges_--what you call the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11375",345,"'Death's-head Moth'?"" The patient went on without stopping.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11376",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11377",345,"""Then he began to whisper: 'Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11378",345,"millions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11379",345,"too. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11380",345,"buzzing flies!' I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11381",345,"Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11382",345,"beckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11383",345,"hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11384",345,"spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11385",345,"then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11386",345,"were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His, only","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11387",345,"smaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11388",345,"seemed to be saying: 'All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11389",345,"and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11390",345,"me!' And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11391",345,"over my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11392",345,"the sash and saying to Him: 'Come in, Lord and Master!' The rats were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11393",345,"all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11394",345,"open an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in through","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11395",345,"the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11396",345,"splendour.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11397",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11398",345,"His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11399",345,"he continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11400",345,"the interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11401",345,"back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: ""Let him go on. Do","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11402",345,"not interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11403",345,"if once he lost the thread of his thought."" He proceeded:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11404",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11405",345,"""All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11406",345,"even a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11407",345,"When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11408",345,"knock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11409",345,"out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11410",345,"owned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn't even smell the same","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11411",345,"as he went by me. I couldn't hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11412",345,"Harker had come into the room.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11413",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11414",345,"The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11415",345,"him so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11416",345,"They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11417",345,"however, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11418",345,"noticing:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11419",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11420",345,"""When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn't the same;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11421",345,"it was like tea after the teapot had been watered."" Here we all moved,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11422",345,"but no one said a word; he went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11423",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11424",345,"""I didn't know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn't look the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11425",345,"same. I don't care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11426",345,"in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn't think of it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11427",345,"at the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11428",345,"to know that He had been taking the life out of her."" I could feel that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11429",345,"the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. ""So when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11430",345,"He came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11431",345,"grabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11432",345,"as I knew I was a madman--at times anyhow--I resolved to use my power.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11433",345,"Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11434",345,"with me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn't","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11435",345,"mean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11436",345,"into me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11437",345,"when I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11438",345,"was a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11439",345,"to steal away under the door."" His voice was becoming fainter and his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11440",345,"breath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11441",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11442",345,"""We know the worst now,"" he said. ""He is here, and we know his purpose.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11443",345,"It may not be too late. Let us be armed--the same as we were the other","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11444",345,"night, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare."" There was no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11445",345,"need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11446",345,"common. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11447",345,"had when we entered the Count's house. The Professor had his ready, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11448",345,"as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11449",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11450",345,"""They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11451",345,"over. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11452",345,"Alas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!"" He stopped; his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11453",345,"voice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11454",345,"my own heart.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11455",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11456",345,"Outside the Harkers' door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11457",345,"latter said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11458",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11459",345,"""Should we disturb her?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11460",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11461",345,"""We must,"" said Van Helsing grimly. ""If the door be locked, I shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11462",345,"break it in.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11463",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11464",345,"""May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11465",345,"room!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11466",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11467",345,"Van Helsing said solemnly, ""You are always right; but this is life and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11468",345,"death. All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11469",345,"are all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11470",345,"the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11471",345,"too, my friends. Now!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11472",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11473",345,"He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11474",345,"ourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11475",345,"headlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11476",345,"across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11477",345,"appalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11478",345,"and my heart seemed to stand still.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11479",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11480",345,"The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11481",345,"was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11482",345,"Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11483",345,"Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11484",345,"figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11485",345,"His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11486",345,"the Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11487",345,"hand he held both Mrs. Harker's hands, keeping them away with her arms","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11488",345,"at full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11489",345,"forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11490",345,"with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man's bare breast which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11491",345,"was shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11492",345,"resemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11493",345,"compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11494",345,"face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11495",345,"into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11496",345,"of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11497",345,"white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11498",345,"champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11499",345,"his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11500",345,"and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11501",345,"and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11502",345,"Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11503",345,"the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11504",345,"lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11505",345,"great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11506",345,"under Quincey's match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11507",345,"looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11508",345,"open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11509",345,"forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11510",345,"it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11511",345,"seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11512",345,"few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11513",345,"ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11514",345,"her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11515",345,"blood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11516",345,"poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11517",345,"Count's terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11518",345,"which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11519",345,"endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11520",345,"over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11521",345,"despairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11522",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11523",345,"""Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11524",345,"do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11525",345,"herself; I must wake him!"" He dipped the end of a towel in cold water","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11526",345,"and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11527",345,"holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11528",345,"heart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11529",345,"window. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11530",345,"Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11531",345,"yew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11532",345,"instant I heard Harker's quick exclamation as he woke to partial","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11533",345,"consciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11534",345,"be, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11535",345,"then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11536",345,"started up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11537",345,"him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11538",345,"however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11539",345,"her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11540",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11541",345,"""In God's name what does this mean?"" Harker cried out. ""Dr. Seward, Dr.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11542",345,"Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11543",345,"what is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11544",345,"this!"" and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11545",345,"together. ""Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!"" With a quick","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11546",345,"movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11547",345,"man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. ""What has happened?","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11548",345,"Tell me all about it!"" he cried without pausing. ""Dr. Van Helsing, you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11549",345,"love Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11550",345,"far yet. Guard her while I look for _him_!"" His wife, through her terror","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11551",345,"and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11552",345,"forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11553",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11554",345,"""No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11555",345,"to-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11556",345,"with me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!"" Her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11557",345,"expression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11558",345,"pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11559",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11560",345,"Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11561",345,"little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11562",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11563",345,"""Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11564",345,"foul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calm","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11565",345,"and take counsel together."" She shuddered and was silent, holding down","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11566",345,"her head on her husband's breast. When she raised it, his white","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11567",345,"night-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11568",345,"the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11569",345,"saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11570",345,"sobs:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11571",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11572",345,"""Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11573",345,"should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11574",345,"most cause to fear."" To this he spoke out resolutely:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11575",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11576",345,"""Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11577",345,"hear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11578",345,"deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11579",345,"if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!"" He put out","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11580",345,"his arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11581",345,"sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11582",345,"damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11583",345,"while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11584",345,"me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11585",345,"power to the utmost:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11586",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11587",345,"""And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11588",345,"fact; tell me all that has been."" I told him exactly what had happened,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11589",345,"and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11590",345,"and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11591",345,"held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11592",345,"the open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11593",345,"see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11594",345,"the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11595",345,"hair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11596",345,"They entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11597",345,"questioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11598",345,"their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11599",345,"and wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11600",345,"to him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11601",345,"answered:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11602",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11603",345,"""I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11604",345,"looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11605",345,"however----"" He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11606",345,"the bed. Van Helsing said gravely:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11607",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11608",345,"""Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11609",345,"is in knowing all. Tell freely!"" So Art went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11610",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11611",345,"""He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11612",345,"seconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11613",345,"burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11614",345,"cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11615",345,"had helped the flames."" Here I interrupted. ""Thank God there is the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11616",345,"other copy in the safe!"" His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11617",345,"went on: ""I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I looked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11618",345,"into Renfield's room; but there was no trace there except----!"" Again he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11619",345,"paused. ""Go on,"" said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11620",345,"moistening his lips with his tongue, added: ""except that the poor fellow","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11621",345,"is dead."" Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11622",345,"us she said solemnly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11623",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11624",345,"""God's will be done!"" I could not but feel that Art was keeping back","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11625",345,"something; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11626",345,"Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11627",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11628",345,"""And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11629",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11630",345,"""A little,"" he answered. ""It may be much eventually, but at present I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11631",345,"can't say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11632",345,"go when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11633",345,"Renfield's window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11634",345,"shape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11635",345,"will not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11636",345,"dawn is close. We must work to-morrow!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11637",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11638",345,"He said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhaps","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11639",345,"a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11640",345,"hear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11641",345,"hand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker's head:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11642",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11643",345,"""And now, Madam Mina--poor, dear, dear Madam Mina--tell us exactly what","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11644",345,"happened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11645",345,"need that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11646",345,"quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11647",345,"end all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11648",345,"learn.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11649",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11650",345,"The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11651",345,"as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11652",345,"lower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11653",345,"out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11654",345,"kissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11655",345,"of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11656",345,"After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11657",345,"began:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11658",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11659",345,"""I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11660",345,"long time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11661",345,"of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11662",345,"connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11663",345,"Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11664",345,"lovingly: ""Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11665",345,"through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11666",345,"to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11667",345,"need your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11668",345,"with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11669",345,"sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11670",345,"more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11671",345,"next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11672",345,"had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11673",345,"it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11674",345,"terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11675",345,"I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11676",345,"seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11677",345,"tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11678",345,"looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11679",345,"the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11680",345,"had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11681",345,"tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11682",345,"the others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11683",345,"fell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11684",345,"teeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11685",345,"sunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11686",345,"red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11687",345,"my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11688",345,"paralysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11689",345,"pointing as he spoke to Jonathan:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11690",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11691",345,"""'Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11692",345,"before your very eyes.' I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11693",345,"say anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11694",345,"and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11695",345,"so, 'First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11696",345,"be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11697",345,"appeased my thirst!' I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11698",345,"want to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11699",345,"such is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11700",345,"me! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!"" Her husband groaned","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11701",345,"again. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11702",345,"he were the injured one, and went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11703",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11704",345,"""I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11705",345,"this horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11706",345,"must have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11707",345,"saw it drip with the fresh blood!"" The remembrance seemed for a while to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11708",345,"overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11709",345,"husband's sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11710",345,"went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11712",345,"""Then he spoke to me mockingly, 'And so you, like the others, would play","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11713",345,"your brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11714",345,"frustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11715",345,"and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. They","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11716",345,"should have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11717",345,"played wits against me--against me who commanded nations, and intrigued","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11718",345,"for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11719",345,"born--I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are now","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11720",345,"to me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11721",345,"wine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11722",345,"helper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11724",345,"have done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11725",345,"call. When my brain says ""Come!"" to you, you shall cross land or sea to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11726",345,"do my bidding; and to that end this!' With that he pulled open his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11727",345,"shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11728",345,"the blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11729",345,"them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11730",345,"the wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- Oh","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11731",345,"my God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11732",345,"fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11733",345,"days. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11734",345,"and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!"" Then she began to rub her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11758",345,"_3 October._--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11759",345,"is now six o'clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11760",345,"take something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11761",345,"that if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11762",345,"knows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11763",345,"not stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11764",345,"the little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11765",345,"not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11766",345,"we must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11767",345,"running down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11768",345,"faith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11769",345,"up to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11770",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11771",345,"When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11772",345,"Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11773",345,"told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11774",345,"they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11775",345,"all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11776",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11777",345,"Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11778",345,"heard anything. He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11779",345,"half dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11780",345,"had called out loudly several times, ""God! God! God!"" after that there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11781",345,"was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11782",345,"on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11783",345,"asked if he had heard ""voices"" or ""a voice,"" and he said he could not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11784",345,"say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11785",345,"there was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11786",345,"to it, if required, that the word ""God"" was spoken by the patient. Dr.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11787",345,"Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11788",345,"the matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11789",345,"would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11790",345,"it was, he thought that on the attendant's evidence he could give a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11791",345,"certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11792",345,"coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11793",345,"to the same result.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11794",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11795",345,"When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11796",345,"step, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11797",345,"confidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11798",345,"kept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11799",345,"to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11800",345,"despair. ""There must be no concealment,"" she said, ""Alas! we have had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11801",345,"too much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11802",345,"give me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11803",345,"Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11804",345,"Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11805",345,"but quietly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11806",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11807",345,"""But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11808",345,"others from yourself, after what has happened?"" Her face grew set in its","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11809",345,"lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11810",345,"answered:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11811",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11812",345,"""Ah no! for my mind is made up!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11813",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11814",345,"""To what?"" he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11815",345,"our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answer","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11816",345,"came with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11817",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11818",345,"""Because if I find in myself--and I shall watch keenly for it--a sign of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11819",345,"harm to any that I love, I shall die!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11820",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11821",345,"""You would not kill yourself?"" he asked, hoarsely.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11822",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11823",345,"""I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11824",345,"pain, and so desperate an effort!"" She looked at him meaningly as she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11825",345,"spoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11826",345,"put his hand on her head as he said solemnly:","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11827",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11828",345,"""My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11829",345,"could hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11830",345,"even at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11831",345,"child----"" For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11832",345,"throat; he gulped it down and went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11833",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11834",345,"""There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11835",345,"die. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Until","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11836",345,"the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11837",345,"die; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would make","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11838",345,"you even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11839",345,"live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11840",345,"himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11841",345,"night; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11842",345,"do not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past."" The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11843",345,"poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11844",345,"quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11845",345,"silent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11846",345,"him said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11847",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11848",345,"""I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11849",345,"strive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11850",345,"have passed away from me."" She was so good and brave that we all felt","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11851",345,"that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11852",345,"began to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11853",345,"the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11854",345,"might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11855",345,"She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if ""pleased"" could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11856",345,"be used in connection with so grim an interest.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11857",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11858",345,"As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11859",345,"prepared with an exact ordering of our work.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11860",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11861",345,"""It is perhaps well,"" he said, ""that at our meeting after our visit to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11862",345,"Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11863",345,"there. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11864",345,"would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11865",345,"effort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11866",345,"intentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11867",345,"power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11868",345,"them as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11869",345,"to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11870",345,"Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11871",345,"and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11872",345,"guards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11873",345,"retain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11874",345,"of his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11875",345,"through cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11876",345,"must open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11877",345,"all his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11878",345,"him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11879",345,"and the destroying shall be, in time, sure."" Here I started up for I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11880",345,"could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11881",345,"preciously laden with Mina's life and happiness were flying from us,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11882",345,"since whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11883",345,"his hand warningly. ""Nay, friend Jonathan,"" he said, ""in this, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11884",345,"quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11885",345,"act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11886",345,"all probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11887",345,"The Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11888",345,"deeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11889",345,"write on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11890",345,"that he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11891",345,"where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11892",345,"very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11893",345,"search that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11894",345,"friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt 'stop the earths' and so we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11895",345,"run down our old fox--so? is it not?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11896",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11897",345,"""Then let us come at once,"" I cried, ""we are wasting the precious,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11898",345,"precious time!"" The Professor did not move, but simply said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11899",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11900",345,"""And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11901",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11902",345,"""Any way!"" I cried. ""We shall break in if need be.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11903",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11904",345,"""And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11905",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11906",345,"I was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11907",345,"reason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11908",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11909",345,"""Don't wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11910",345,"in.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11911",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11912",345,"""Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11913",345,"your anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11914",345,"movement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11915",345,"seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11916",345,"into the house, but we have no key; is it not so?"" I nodded.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11917",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11918",345,"""Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11919",345,"not still get in; and think there was to you no conscience of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11920",345,"housebreaker, what would you do?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11921",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11922",345,"""I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11924",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11925",345,"""And your police, they would interfere, would they not?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11926",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11927",345,"""Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11928",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11929",345,"""Then,"" he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, ""all that is in doubt is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11930",345,"the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11931",345,"whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11932",345,"police must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in reading","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11933",345,"the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11934",345,"friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11935",345,"your London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11936",345,"things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11937",345,"no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11938",345,"house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11939",345,"and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11940",345,"got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11941",345,"and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11942",345,"have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11943",345,"and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11944",345,"that other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11945",345,"that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11946",345,"within a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11949",345,"_en règle_; and in our work we shall be _en règle_ too. We shall not go","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11950",345,"so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11951",345,"it strange; but we shall go after ten o'clock, when there are many","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"11977",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11978",345,"Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11979",345,"that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11980",345,"terrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale--almost","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11981",345,"ghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11982",345,"somewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should give","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11983",345,"her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11984",345,"what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. As","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11985",345,"yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11986",345,"was short, and there was time for fear.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11987",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11988",345,"When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11989",345,"disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11990",345,"finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11991",345,"Count's lair close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11992",345,"should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11993",345,"presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11994",345,"some new clue.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11995",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11996",345,"As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11997",345,"after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11998",345,"that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"11999",345,"and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12000",345,"It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12001",345,"might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12002",345,"able to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12003",345,"follow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12004",345,"my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12005",345,"Mina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12006",345,"not listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matter","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12007",345,"in which I could be useful; that amongst the Count's papers might be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12008",345,"some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12009",345,"and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12010",345,"cope with the Count's extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12011",345,"resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12012",345,"we should all work together. ""As for me,"" she said, ""I have no fear.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12013",345,"Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12014",345,"have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12015",345,"He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present."" So I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12016",345,"started up crying out: ""Then in God's name let us come at once, for we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12017",345,"are losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12018",345,"think.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12019",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12020",345,"""Not so!"" said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12021",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12022",345,"""But why?"" I asked.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12023",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12024",345,"""Do you forget,"" he said, with actually a smile, ""that last night he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12025",345,"banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12026",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12027",345,"Did I forget! shall I ever--can I ever! Can any of us ever forget that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12028",345,"terrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12029",345,"the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12030",345,"shuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12031",345,"frightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12032",345,"the affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12033",345,"he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. ""Oh,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12034",345,"Madam Mina,"" he said, ""dear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12035",345,"reverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12036",345,"lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12037",345,"forget it, will you not?"" He bent low beside her as he spoke; she took","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12038",345,"his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12039",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12040",345,"""No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12041",345,"have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12042",345,"together. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12043",345,"must all eat that we may be strong.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12044",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12045",345,"Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12046",345,"encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12047",345,"us. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12048",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12049",345,"""Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12050",345,"all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12051",345,"lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?"" We all assured","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12052",345,"him. ""Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case _quite_ safe","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12053",345,"here until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if---- We shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12054",345,"return! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12055",345,"have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12056",345,"of things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12057",345,"yourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12058",345,"name of the Father, the Son, and----""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12059",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12060",345,"There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12061",345,"had placed the Wafer on Mina's forehead, it had seared it--had burned","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12062",345,"into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12063",345,"darling's brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12064",345,"her nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12065",345,"her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12066",345,"words to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12067",345,"to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12068",345,"knees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12069",345,"over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12070",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12071",345,"""Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12072",345,"bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day."" They","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12073",345,"all paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12074",345,"grief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12075",345,"sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12076",345,"their eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12077",345,"gravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12078",345,"way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12079",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12080",345,"""It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12081",345,"as He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12082",345,"the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12083",345,"Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12084",345,"red scar, the sign of God's knowledge of what has been, shall pass away,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12085",345,"and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12086",345,"we live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12087",345,"burden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12088",345,"in obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12089",345,"His good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12090",345,"through stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12091",345,"fears, and all that makes the difference between God and man.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12092",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12093",345,"There was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12094",345,"Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12095",345,"man's hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12096",345,"knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12097",345,"other. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12098",345,"head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12099",345,"and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12100",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12101",345,"It was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12102",345,"neither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12103",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12104",345,"To one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12105",345,"vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12106",345,"land alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12107",345,"many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12108",345,"the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12109",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12110",345,"We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12111",345,"the first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12112",345,"surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12113",345,"fear as already we knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12114",345,"not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12115",345,"with our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12116",345,"in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12117",345,"Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12118",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12119",345,"""And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12120",345,"earth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12121",345,"distant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth because it has","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12122",345,"been holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12123",345,"holy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12124",345,"God."" As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12125",345,"very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12126",345,"musty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12127",345,"was concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12128",345,"Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12129",345,"the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12130",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12131",345,"One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12132",345,"them as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portion","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12133",345,"of the Host.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12134",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12135",345,"When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"12137",345,"""So much is already done. If it may be that with all the others we can","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"12142",345,"train we could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly, and in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12143",345,"window of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nodded to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12144",345,"tell that our work there was successfully accomplished. She nodded in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12145",345,"reply to show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12146",345,"hand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12147",345,"and just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12148",345,"platform.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"12157",345,"""Quincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12158",345,"case there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"12160",345,"solicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12161",345,"should have known better."" I demurred as to my not sharing any danger","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12162",345,"even of odium, but he went on: ""Besides, it will attract less attention","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12163",345,"if there are not too many of us. My title will make it all right with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12164",345,"the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12165",345,"better go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12166",345,"somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12167",345,"the smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12168",345,"lookout for you, and shall let you in.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12169",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12170",345,"""The advice is good!"" said Van Helsing, so we said no more. Godalming","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12171",345,"and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another. At the corner","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12172",345,"of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12173",345,"Park. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12174",345,"centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12175",345,"its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a bench","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12176",345,"within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12177",345,"attention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12178",345,"waited for the coming of the others.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12179",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12180",345,"At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12181",345,"fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descended","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12182",345,"a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12183",345,"the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the two","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12184",345,"ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12185",345,"The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12186",345,"of the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12187",345,"along. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12188",345,"placed his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12189",345,"selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12190",345,"fashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12191",345,"turning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12192",345,"the man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12193",345,"began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12194",345,"about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12195",345,"door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12196",345,"entered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12197",345,"Helsing's went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12198",345,"workman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12199",345,"open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12200",345,"This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12201",345,"gave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12202",345,"coat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12203",345,"transaction.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12204",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12205",345,"When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12206",345,"the door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12207",345,"Lord Godalming lighting a cigar.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12208",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12209",345,"""The place smells so vilely,"" said the latter as we came in. It did","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12210",345,"indeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at Carfax--and with our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12211",345,"previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12212",345,"place pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12213",345,"in case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12214",345,"with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12215",345,"house. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12216",345,"eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12217",345,"Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12218",345,"missing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12219",345,"across a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12220",345,"pointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12221",345,"windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12222",345,"lose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12223",345,"brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12224",345,"treated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12225",345,"Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12226",345,"any of his effects.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12227",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12228",345,"After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12229",345,"we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12230",345,"which might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12231",345,"them. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12232",345,"table. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12233",345,"deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12234",345,"note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12235",345,"wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12236",345,"brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin--the latter containing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12237",345,"dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12238",345,"little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12239",345,"the other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12240",345,"and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12241",345,"houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12242",345,"bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12243",345,"are, with what patience we can, waiting their return--or the coming of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12244",345,"the Count.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"12254",345,"_3 October._--The time seemed terrible long whilst we were waiting for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12255",345,"the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12256",345,"our minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12257",345,"purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12258",345,"The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12259",345,"Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12260",345,"face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-day he is a drawn,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12261",345,"haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12262",345,"eyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12263",345,"fact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, for, if","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12264",345,"all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12265",345,"in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12266",345,"thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his----! The Professor knows","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12267",345,"this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12268",345,"has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12269",345,"well as I can remember, here it is:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12270",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12271",345,"""I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12272",345,"the papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12273",345,"greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12274",345,"are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12275",345,"it. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12276",345,"he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12277",345,"alchemist--which latter was the highest development of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12278",345,"science-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12279",345,"compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12280",345,"attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12281",345,"that he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12282",345,"physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12283",345,"In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12284",345,"growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12285",345,"man's stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12286",345,"been that we have crossed his path he would be yet--he may be yet if we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12287",345,"fail--the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12288",345,"lead through Death, not Life.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12289",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12290",345,"Harker groaned and said, ""And this is all arrayed against my darling!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12291",345,"But how is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us to defeat him!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12292",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12293",345,"""He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12294",345,"surely; that big child-brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12295",345,"yet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12296",345,"things he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12297",345,"to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12298",345,"and to go slow. _Festina lente_ may well be his motto.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12299",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12300",345,"""I fail to understand,"" said Harker wearily. ""Oh, do be more plain to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12301",345,"me! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12302",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12303",345,"The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12304",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12305",345,"""Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12306",345,"monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How he has been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12307",345,"making use of the zoöphagous patient to effect his entry into friend","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12308",345,"John's home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12309",345,"and how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12310",345,"an inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12311",345,"see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12312",345,"knew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12313",345,"child-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12314",345,"might not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12315",345,"found that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12316",345,"progress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12317",345,"they are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12318",345,"that he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12319",345,"form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12320",345,"hiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12321",345,"just too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12322",345,"and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12323",345,"can move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12324",345,"there not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be even","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12325",345,"more careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12326",345,"well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12327",345,"day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12328",345,"five of us when those absent ones return.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12329",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12330",345,"Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12331",345,"double postman's knock of the telegraph boy. We all moved out to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12332",345,"hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12333",345,"keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12334",345,"despatch. The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12335",345,"direction, opened it and read aloud.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12336",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12337",345,"""Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12338",345,"hastened towards the South. He seems to be going the round and may want","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12339",345,"to see you: Mina.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12340",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12341",345,"There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker's voice:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12342",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12343",345,"""Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!"" Van Helsing turned to him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12344",345,"quickly and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12345",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12346",345,"""God will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12347",345,"as yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12348",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12349",345,"""I care for nothing now,"" he answered hotly, ""except to wipe out this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12350",345,"brute from the face of creation. I would sell my soul to do it!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12351",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12352",345,"""Oh, hush, hush, my child!"" said Van Helsing. ""God does not purchase","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12353",345,"souls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12354",345,"faith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12355",345,"devotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12356",345,"doubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12357",345,"all devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. The time is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12358",345,"coming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of man,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12359",345,"and till sunset he may not change. It will take him time to arrive","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12360",345,"here--see, it is twenty minutes past one--and there are yet some times","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12361",345,"before he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we must hope for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12362",345,"is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12363",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12364",345,"About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker's telegram, there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12365",345,"came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinary","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12366",345,"knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12367",345,"the Professor's heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12368",345,"together moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12369",345,"armaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. Van","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12370",345,"Helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12371",345,"back, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12372",345,"must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12373",345,"saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12374",345,"the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12375",345,"hall:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12376",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12377",345,"""It is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12378",345,"destroyed them all!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12379",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12380",345,"""Destroyed?"" asked the Professor.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12381",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12382",345,"""For him!"" We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12383",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12384",345,"""There's nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, he doesn't turn up","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12385",345,"by five o'clock, we must start off; for it won't do to leave Mrs. Harker","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12386",345,"alone after sunset.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12387",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12388",345,"""He will be here before long now,"" said Van Helsing, who had been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12389",345,"consulting his pocket-book. ""_Nota bene_, in Madam's telegram he went","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12390",345,"south from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12391",345,"only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12392",345,"o'clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12393",345,"suspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12394",345,"suspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12395",345,"short time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12396",345,"Mile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12397",345,"carried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12398",345,"have long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12399",345,"we may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12400",345,"arms! Be ready!"" He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12401",345,"hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12402",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12403",345,"I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12404",345,"dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12405",345,"adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12406",345,"been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12407",345,"accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12408",345,"renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12409",345,"laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12410",345,"gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12411",345,"just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12412",345,"guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12413",345,"Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12414",345,"move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12415",345,"seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12416",345,"the hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12417",345,"he feared it.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12418",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12419",345,"Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12420",345,"us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12421",345,"so panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12422",345,"to sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12423",345,"Harker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12424",345,"leading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12425",345,"horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12426",345,"and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12427",345,"lion-like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a single","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12428",345,"impulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12429",345,"better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12430",345,"we were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12431",345,"avail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12432",345,"ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12433",345,"blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12434",345,"leap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12435",345,"through his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12436",345,"making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12437",345,"fell out. The expression of the Count's face was so hellish, that for a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12438",345,"moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12439",345,"aloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12440",345,"protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12441",345,"felt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12442",345,"saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12443",345,"by each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12444",345,"hate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came over","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12445",345,"the Count's face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12446",345,"of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12447",345,"pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12448",345,"dive he swept under Harker's arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12449",345,"a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12450",345,"himself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12451",345,"he tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12452",345,"shivering glass I could hear the ""ting"" of the gold, as some of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12453",345,"sovereigns fell on the flagging.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12454",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12455",345,"We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12456",345,"the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12457",345,"There he turned and spoke to us:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12458",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12459",345,"""You think to baffle me, you--with your pale faces all in a row, like","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12460",345,"sheep in a butcher's. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You think","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12461",345,"you have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12462",345,"just begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Your","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12463",345,"girls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12464",345,"others shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12465",345,"jackals when I want to feed. Bah!"" With a contemptuous sneer, he passed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12466",345,"quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12467",345,"fastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of us","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12468",345,"to speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of following","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12469",345,"him through the stable, we moved toward the hall.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12470",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12471",345,"""We have learnt something--much! Notwithstanding his brave words, he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12472",345,"fears us; he fear time, he fear want! For if not, why he hurry so? His","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12473",345,"very tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? You","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12474",345,"follow quick. You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. For","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12475",345,"me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12476",345,"return."" As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; took","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12477",345,"the title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12478",345,"remaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12479",345,"a match.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12480",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12481",345,"Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12482",345,"lowered himself from the window to follow the Count. He had, however,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12483",345,"bolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12484",345,"was no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12485",345,"of the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12486",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12487",345,"It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We had to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12488",345,"recognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12489",345,"Professor when he said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12490",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12491",345,"""Let us go back to Madam Mina--poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can do","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12492",345,"just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we need","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12493",345,"not despair. There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to find","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12494",345,"it; when that is done all may yet be well."" I could see that he spoke as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12495",345,"bravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12496",345,"down; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress--he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12497",345,"was thinking of his wife.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12498",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12499",345,"With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12500",345,"waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12501",345,"bravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12502",345,"pale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12503",345,"in secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12504",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12505",345,"""I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!"" As she spoke,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12506",345,"she took her husband's grey head in her hands and kissed it--""Lay your","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12507",345,"poor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protect","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12508",345,"us if He so will it in His good intent."" The poor fellow groaned. There","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12509",345,"was no place for words in his sublime misery.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12510",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12511",345,"We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12512",345,"all up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12513",345,"people--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the sense","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12514",345,"of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12515",345,"miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12516",345,"our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12517",345,"although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12518",345,"threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12519",345,"manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12520",345,"part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12521",345,"her husband's arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12522",345,"protect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12523",345,"till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12524",345,"to the present time. Then without letting go her husband's hand she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12525",345,"stood up amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12526",345,"scene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12527",345,"of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12528",345,"she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12529",345,"teeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12530",345,"our grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12531",345,"we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12532",345,"purity and faith, was outcast from God.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12533",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12534",345,"""Jonathan,"" she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12535",345,"so full of love and tenderness, ""Jonathan dear, and you all my true,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12536",345,"true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12537",345,"dreadful time. I know that you must fight--that you must destroy even as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12538",345,"you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12539",345,"but it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12540",345,"misery is the saddest case of all. Just think what will be his joy when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12541",345,"he, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12542",345,"spiritual immortality. You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12543",345,"not hold your hands from his destruction.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12544",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12545",345,"As she spoke I could see her husband's face darken and draw together, as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12546",345,"though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12547",345,"Instinctively the clasp on his wife's hand grew closer, till his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12548",345,"knuckles looked white. She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12549",345,"must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12550",345,"than ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12551",345,"his hand from hers as he spoke:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12552",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12553",345,"""May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12554",345,"earthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could send","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12555",345,"his soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12556",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12557",345,"""Oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God. Don't say such things,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12558",345,"Jonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror. Just","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12559",345,"think, my dear--I have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12560",345,"... perhaps ... some day ... I, too, may need such pity; and that some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12561",345,"other like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me! Oh,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12562",345,"my husband! my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12563",345,"had there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasured","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12564",345,"your wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12565",345,"sorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12566",345,"of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12567",345,"so many sorrows have come.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12568",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12569",345,"We men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and we wept","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12570",345,"openly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12571",345,"Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12572",345,"round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckoned","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12573",345,"to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12574",345,"with their God.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12575",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12576",345,"Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12577",345,"of the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12578",345,"She tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12579",345,"husband's sake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle; and was,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12580",345,"I think and believe, not without its reward. Van Helsing had placed at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12581",345,"hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12582",345,"When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12583",345,"sit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12584",345,"poor stricken lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12585",345,"shall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12586",345,"for his is the second watch. Now that my work is done I, too, shall go","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"12592",345,"_3-4 October, close to midnight._--I thought yesterday would never end.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12593",345,"There was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12594",345,"that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12595",345,"now be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12596",345,"was to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that one","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12597",345,"earth-box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was. If he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12598",345,"chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years; and in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"12600",345,"This I know: that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12601",345,"one is my poor wronged darling. I love her a thousand times more for her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12602",345,"sweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monster","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12603",345,"seem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12604",345,"by the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all drifting","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12605",345,"reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12606",345,"sleeping, and sleeping without dreams. I fear what her dreams might be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12607",345,"like, with such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12608",345,"calm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there came","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12609",345,"over her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12610",345,"I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"12643",345,"dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"12656",345,"""Is anything wrong?"" he asked, in alarm.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12657",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12658",345,"""No,"" I replied; ""but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12659",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12660",345,"""I will go,"" he said, and hurried into the Professor's room.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12661",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12662",345,"In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12663",345,"dressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12664",345,"the door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina smile--a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12665",345,"positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12666",345,"said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12667",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12668",345,"""Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12669",345,"we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us to-day!"" Then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12670",345,"turning to her, he said, cheerfully: ""And what am I do for you? For at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12671",345,"this hour you do not want me for nothings.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12672",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12673",345,"""I want you to hypnotise me!"" she said. ""Do it before the dawn, for I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12674",345,"feel that then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12675",345,"short!"" Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12676",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12677",345,"Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12678",345,"from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Mina","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12679",345,"gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12680",345,"like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12681",345,"her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12682",345,"her bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a few","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12683",345,"more passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12684",345,"covered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12685",345,"did not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12686",345,"her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12687",345,"impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12688",345,"They came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12689",345,"foot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12690",345,"stillness was broken by Van Helsing's voice speaking in a low level tone","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12691",345,"which would not break the current of her thoughts:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12692",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12693",345,"""Where are you?"" The answer came in a neutral way:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12694",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12695",345,"""I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own."" For several","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12696",345,"minutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12697",345,"staring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12698",345,"was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina's face, Dr. Van","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12699",345,"Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12700",345,"just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12701",345,"itself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12702",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12703",345,"""Where are you now?"" The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12704",345,"were as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her use the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12705",345,"same tone when reading her shorthand notes.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12706",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12707",345,"""I do not know. It is all strange to me!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12708",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12709",345,"""What do you see?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12710",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12711",345,"""I can see nothing; it is all dark.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12712",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12713",345,"""What do you hear?"" I could detect the strain in the Professor's patient","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12714",345,"voice.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12715",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12716",345,"""The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I can","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12717",345,"hear them on the outside.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12718",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12719",345,"""Then you are on a ship?"" We all looked at each other, trying to glean","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12720",345,"something each from the other. We were afraid to think. The answer came","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12721",345,"quick:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12722",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12723",345,"""Oh, yes!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12724",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12725",345,"""What else do you hear?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12726",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12727",345,"""The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12728",345,"creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12729",345,"falls into the rachet.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12730",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12731",345,"""What are you doing?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12732",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12733",345,"""I am still--oh, so still. It is like death!"" The voice faded away into","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12734",345,"a deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12735",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12736",345,"By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12737",345,"day. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina's shoulders, and laid her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12738",345,"head down softly on her pillow. She lay like a sleeping child for a few","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12739",345,"moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12740",345,"us all around her. ""Have I been talking in my sleep?"" was all she said.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12741",345,"She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12742",345,"was eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12743",345,"conversation, and she said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12744",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12745",345,"""Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!"" Mr.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12746",345,"Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor's calm","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12747",345,"voice called them back:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12748",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12749",345,"""Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12750",345,"whilst she spoke. There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12751",345,"your so great Port of London. Which of them is it that you seek? God be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12752",345,"thanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12753",345,"know not. We have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12754",345,"since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12755",345,"forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12756",345,"that sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12757",345,"Count's mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan's so fierce","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12758",345,"knife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape. Hear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12759",345,"me, ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of men","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12760",345,"following like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12761",345,"have take his last earth-box on board a ship, and he leave the land. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12762",345,"think to escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12763",345,"say when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12764",345,"we must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12765",345,"little while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12766",345,"between us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12767",345,"would--unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12768",345,"slack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12769",345,"us. Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12770",345,"and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12771",345,"us."" Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12772",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12773",345,"""But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?"" He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12774",345,"took her hand and patted it as he replied:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12775",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12776",345,"""Ask me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"12778",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12779",345,"After breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked at her gravely for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12780",345,"a minute and then said sorrowfully:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12781",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12782",345,"""Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"12810",345,"to his Castle in Transylvania. I know it so well, as if a great hand of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12811",345,"fire wrote it on the wall. He have prepare for this in some way, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12812",345,"that last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. For this he took the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12813",345,"money; for this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12814",345,"go down. It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the tomb that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"12816",345,"But there was not of time. When that fail he make straight for his last","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"12871",345,"""As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12872",345,"he must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12873",345,"by that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. _Omne","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12874",345,"ignotum pro magnifico_; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12875",345,"ships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12876",345,"Madam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12877",345,"your list of the shipping in the _Times_, and so we go, by suggestion of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12878",345,"Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd's, where are note of all ships that sail,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12879",345,"however so small. There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship go","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12880",345,"out with the tide. She is the _Czarina Catherine_, and she sail from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12881",345,"Doolittle's Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12882",345,"Danube. 'Soh!' said I, 'this is the ship whereon is the Count.' So off","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12883",345,"we go to Doolittle's Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12884",345,"so small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquire","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12885",345,"of the goings of the _Czarina Catherine_. He swear much, and he red face","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12886",345,"and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quincey","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12887",345,"give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12888",345,"put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12889",345,"still better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12890",345,"many men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12891",345,"have been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12892",345,"others which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12893",345,"nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"12897",345,"and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12898",345,"black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12899",345,"time. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12900",345,"sails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12901",345,"then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12902",345,"gang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12903",345,"told that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12904",345,"agree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12905",345,"and cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12906",345,"driving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12907",345,"take several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12908",345,"captain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12909",345,"it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12910",345,"can come and see where it shall be. But he say 'no'; that he come not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12911",345,"yet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12912",345,"had better be quick--with blood--for that his ship will leave the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12913",345,"place--of blood--before the turn of the tide--with blood. Then the thin","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12914",345,"man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12915",345,"will be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12916",345,"polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12917",345,"will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12918",345,"sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12919",345,"him that he doesn't want no Frenchmen--with bloom upon them and also","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12920",345,"with blood--in his ship--with blood on her also. And so, after asking","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12921",345,"where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12922",345,"forms, he departed.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12923",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12924",345,"""No one knew where he went 'or bloomin' well cared,' as they said, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12925",345,"they had something else to think of--well with blood again; for it soon","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12926",345,"became apparent to all that the _Czarina Catherine_ would not sail as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12927",345,"was expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12928",345,"and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12929",345,"The captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12930",345,"blood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12931",345,"fear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12932",345,"when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12933",345,"asked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain replied","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12934",345,"that he wished that he and his box--old and with much bloom and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12935",345,"blood--were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12936",345,"with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12937",345,"on deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12938",345,"Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12939",345,"all was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12940",345,"of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain's swears","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12941",345,"exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12942",345,"picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12943",345,"and down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12944",345,"of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12945",345,"went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12946",345,"river mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12947",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12948",345,"""And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12949",345,"our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12950",345,"Danube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12951",345,"we start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12952",345,"is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12953",345,"he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12954",345,"are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12955",345,"where he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12956",345,"invoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12957",345,"Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12958",345,"his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12959",345,"When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12960",345,"have inquiry made at Varna, we say 'no'; for what is to be done is not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12961",345,"for police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our own","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12962",345,"way.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12963",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12964",345,"When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12965",345,"that the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied: ""We have the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12966",345,"best proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12967",345,"morning."" I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12968",345,"pursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12969",345,"he would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12970",345,"at first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12971",345,"forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12972",345,"of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12973",345,"men:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12974",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12975",345,"""Yes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary! For your sake in the first,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12976",345,"and then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harm","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12977",345,"already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12978",345,"time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12979",345,"darkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12980",345,"dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12981",345,"in that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12982",345,"own barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to a new land where life","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12983",345,"of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12984",345,"work of centuries. Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12985",345,"what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12986",345,"been, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12987",345,"nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12988",345,"some wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12989",345,"all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12990",345,"world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12991",345,"There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12992",345,"of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12993",345,"there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12994",345,"occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12995",345,"himself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12996",345,"time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12997",345,"more braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12998",345,"strange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"12999",345,"thrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13000",345,"is surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13001",345,"and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13002",345,"infect you--oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13003",345,"good of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he do","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13004",345,"no more, you have only to live--to live in your own old, sweet way; and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13005",345,"so in time, death, which is of man's common lot and with God's sanction,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13006",345,"shall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn together","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13007",345,"that it must not. Thus are we ministers of God's own wish: that the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13008",345,"world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13009",345,"whose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13010",345,"soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13011",345,"more. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13012",345,"we fall, we fall in good cause."" He paused and I said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13013",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13014",345,"""But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13015",345,"from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13017",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13018",345,"""Aha!"" he said, ""your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13019",345,"adopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13020",345,"tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13021",345,"unceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13022",345,"tiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13023",345,"is not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he go","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13024",345,"over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13025",345,"beaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13026",345,"Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13027",345,"him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13028",345,"does he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13029",345,"him. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13030",345,"find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13031",345,"study new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of old","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13032",345,"ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13033",345,"land and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13034",345,"he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. Nay, it help","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13035",345,"him to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13036",345,"the first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13037",345,"ruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13038",345,"world of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we know","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13039",345,"him; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13040",345,"peoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13041",345,"what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13042",345,"are pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13043",345,"efforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13044",345,"even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13045",345,"strength. It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13046",345,"to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13047",345,"for the safety of one we love--for the good of mankind, and for the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13068",345,"_5 October._--We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13069",345,"each and all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13070",345,"general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13071",345,"again.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13072",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13073",345,"It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13074",345,"any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way--even by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13075",345,"death--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13076",345,"than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13077",345,"the whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13078",345,"caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker's forehead that I was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13079",345,"brought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13080",345,"matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13081",345,"trouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13082",345,"trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13083",345,"recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13084",345,"meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13085",345,"action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13086",345,"rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13087",345,"that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker's tongue is tied. I _know_","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13088",345,"that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13089",345,"guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13090",345,"cannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13091",345,"he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13092",345,"that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13093",345,"Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called ""the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13094",345,"Vampire's baptism of blood."" Well, there may be a poison that distils","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13095",345,"itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13096",345,"a mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13097",345,"instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker's silences, then there is a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13098",345,"terrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us. The same","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13099",345,"power that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13100",345,"further; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13109",345,"say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13110",345,"about the bush a little, he said suddenly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13111",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13112",345,"""Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13113",345,"at the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13114",345,"confidence""; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13116",345,"""Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing."" A cold shiver ran","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13117",345,"through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13118",345,"continued:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13119",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13120",345,"""With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13121",345,"before things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult than","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13122",345,"ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13123",345,"can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13124",345,"but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13125",345,"without to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13126",345,"are more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13127",345,"often; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13128",345,"wrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13129",345,"it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13130",345,"hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13131",345,"have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13132",345,"will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?"" I nodded","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13133",345,"acquiescence; he went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13134",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13135",345,"""Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13136",345,"our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painful","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13137",345,"task! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13138",345,"When to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13139",345,"to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13140",345,"us."" He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13141",345,"at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13142",345,"soul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfort","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13143",345,"to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13144",345,"any rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13145",345,"effect was as I expected.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13146",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13147",345,"It is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13148",345,"gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13149",345,"really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13150",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13151",345,"       *       *       *       *       *","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13152",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13153",345,"_Later._--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13154",345,"experienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13155",345,"message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13156",345,"she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13157",345,"without her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at each","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13158",345,"other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my own","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13159",345,"part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13160",345,"much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13161",345,"agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13162",345,"preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13163",345,"confer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13164",345,"Helsing roughly put the facts before us first:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13165",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13166",345,"""The _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning. It will take","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13167",345,"her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13168",345,"reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13169",345,"Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship's voyage, owing to such","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13170",345,"weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and if","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13171",345,"we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13172",345,"then we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quite","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13173",345,"safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13174",345,"be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13175",345,"preparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed--armed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13176",345,"against evil things, spiritual as well as physical."" Here Quincey Morris","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13177",345,"added:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13178",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13179",345,"""I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13180",345,"that he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13181",345,"our armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13182",345,"trouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13183",345,"after us at Tobolsk? What wouldn't we have given then for a repeater","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13184",345,"apiece!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13185",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13186",345,"""Good!"" said Van Helsing, ""Winchesters it shall be. Quincey's head is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13187",345,"level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13188",345,"dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13189",345,"can do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13190",345,"us, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13191",345,"To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13192",345,"four can set out on our journey.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13193",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13194",345,"""We four?"" said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13195",345,"us.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13196",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13197",345,"""Of course!"" answered the Professor quickly, ""you must remain to take","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13198",345,"care of your so sweet wife!"" Harker was silent for awhile and then said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13199",345,"in a hollow voice:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13200",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13201",345,"""Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13202",345,"Mina."" I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13203",345,"to disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13204",345,"significantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13205",345,"turned away.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13210",345,"_5 October, afternoon._--For some time after our meeting this morning I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13211",345,"could not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13212",345,"wonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina's determination not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13213",345,"to take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13214",345,"argue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as ever from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13215",345,"a solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13216",345,"last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13217",345,"more concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13218",345,"and sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved and her face beams","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13219",345,"with happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13223",345,"_Later._--How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina's happy sleep, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13224",345,"came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13225",345,"evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13226",345,"lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13227",345,"once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13228",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13229",345,"""Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13230",345,"promise made to me, but made holily in God's hearing, and not to be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13231",345,"broken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13232",345,"tears. Quick, you must make it to me at once.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13233",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13234",345,"""Mina,"" I said, ""a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13235",345,"no right to make it.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13236",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13237",345,"""But, dear one,"" she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13238",345,"were like pole stars, ""it is I who wish it; and it is not for myself.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13239",345,"You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13240",345,"do as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13241",345,"from the promise.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13242",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13243",345,"""I promise!"" I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13244",345,"to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13245",345,"She said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13246",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13247",345,"""Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13248",345,"the campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13249",345,"implication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!"" and she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13250",345,"solemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13251",345,"solemnly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13252",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13253",345,"""I promise!"" and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13254",345,"been shut between us.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13257",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13258",345,"_Later, midnight._--Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13259",345,"So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13260",345,"somewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13261",345,"of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retired","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13262",345,"early. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13263",345,"that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13264",345,"trouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13265",345,"Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night. I shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13270",345,"_6 October, morning._--Another surprise. Mina woke me early, about the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13271",345,"same time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thought","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13272",345,"that it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13273",345,"for the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I found","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13274",345,"him dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13275",345,"opening of the door of our room. He came at once; as he passed into the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13276",345,"room, he asked Mina if the others might come, too.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13277",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13278",345,"""No,"" she said quite simply, ""it will not be necessary. You can tell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13281",345,"Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment's pause he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13282",345,"asked:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13284",345,"""But why?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13288",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13289",345,"""But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnest","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13291",345,"any of us from--from circumstances--things that have been."" He paused,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13292",345,"embarrassed.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13293",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13294",345,"As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13296",345,"""I know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13297",345,"coming up; I may not be able again. I know that when the Count wills me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13298",345,"I must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13299",345,"wile; by any device to hoodwink--even Jonathan."" God saw the look that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13300",345,"she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13301",345,"that look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13302",345,"hand. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13303",345,"tears. She went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13304",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13305",345,"""You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13306",345,"can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13307",345,"to guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13308",345,"and so learn that which even I myself do not know."" Dr. Van Helsing said","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13309",345,"very gravely:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13310",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13311",345,"""Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13312",345,"together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve."" When he had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13313",345,"spoken, Mina's long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13314",345,"back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13315",345,"the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13316",345,"motioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13317",345,"a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13318",345,"He told them what Mina had said, and went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13320",345,"""In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13322",345,"to tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13323",345,"warned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13369",345,"times for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13370",345,"danger--some new pain, which, however, may in God's will be means to a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13385",345,"_11 October, Evening._--Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13386",345,"says he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13387",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13388",345,"I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13389",345,"Harker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13390",345,"understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13391",345,"when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13392",345,"or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13393",345,"begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13394",345,"till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13395",345,"the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13396",345,"negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13397",345,"freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13398",345,"change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13399",345,"warning silence.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13400",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13401",345,"To-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13402",345,"signs of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13403",345,"violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very few","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13404",345,"minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13405",345,"her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13406",345,"she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband's hand","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13407",345,"in hers began:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13408",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13409",345,"""We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13410",345,"dear; I know that you will always be with me to the end."" This was to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13411",345,"her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. ""In","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13412",345,"the morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13413",345,"store for any of us. You are going to be so good to me as to take me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13414",345,"with you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13415",345,"woman, whose soul perhaps is lost--no, no, not yet, but is at any rate","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13416",345,"at stake--you will do. But you must remember that I am not as you are.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13417",345,"There is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13418",345,"must destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. Oh, my friends, you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13419",345,"know as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13420",345,"is one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!"" She looked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13421",345,"appealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13422",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13423",345,"""What is that way?"" asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. ""What is that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13424",345,"way, which we must not--may not--take?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13425",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13426",345,"""That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13427",345,"the greater evil is entirely wrought. I know, and you know, that were I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13428",345,"once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13429",345,"did my poor Lucy's. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13430",345,"that stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13431",345,"friends who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to die","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13432",345,"in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13433",345,"done, is God's will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13434",345,"certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13435",345,"blackest things that the world or the nether world holds!"" We were all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13436",345,"silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13437",345,"faces of the others were set and Harker's grew ashen grey; perhaps he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13438",345,"guessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13439",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13440",345,"""This is what I can give into the hotch-pot."" I could not but note the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13441",345,"quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13442",345,"seriousness. ""What will each of you give? Your lives I know,"" she went","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13443",345,"on quickly, ""that is easy for brave men. Your lives are God's, and you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13444",345,"can give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?"" She looked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13445",345,"again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband's face. Quincey","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13446",345,"seemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. ""Then I shall tell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13447",345,"you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13448",345,"connection between us now. You must promise me, one and all--even you,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13449",345,"my beloved husband--that, should the time come, you will kill me.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13450",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13451",345,"""What is that time?"" The voice was Quincey's, but it was low and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13452",345,"strained.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13453",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13454",345,"""When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13455",345,"I die than I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13456",345,"without a moment's delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13457",345,"or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13458",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13459",345,"Quincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13460",345,"and taking her hand in his said solemnly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13461",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13462",345,"""I'm only a rough fellow, who hasn't, perhaps, lived as a man should to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13463",345,"win such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13464",345,"dear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13465",345,"that you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13466",345,"certain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13467",345,"come!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13468",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13469",345,"""My true friend!"" was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13470",345,"bending over, she kissed his hand.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13471",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13472",345,"""I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!"" said Van Helsing.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13473",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13474",345,"""And I!"" said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13475",345,"take the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13476",345,"wan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13477",345,"his hair, and asked:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13478",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13479",345,"""And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13480",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13481",345,"""You too, my dearest,"" she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13482",345,"voice and eyes. ""You must not shrink. You are nearest and dearest and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13483",345,"all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13484",345,"time. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13485",345,"their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13486",345,"hands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more because","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13487",345,"those that they loved implored them to slay them. It is men's duty","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13488",345,"towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! And oh, my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13489",345,"dear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13490",345,"the hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13491",345,"forgotten your mercy in poor Lucy's case to him who loved""--she stopped","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13492",345,"with a flying blush, and changed her phrase--""to him who had best right","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13493",345,"to give her peace. If that time shall come again, I look to you to make","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13494",345,"it a happy memory of my husband's life that it was his loving hand which","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13495",345,"set me free from the awful thrall upon me.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13496",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13497",345,"""Again I swear!"" came the Professor's resonant voice. Mrs. Harker","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13498",345,"smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13499",345,"said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13500",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13501",345,"""And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget:","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13502",345,"this time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13503",345,"such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity. At such a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13504",345,"time I myself might be--nay! if the time ever comes, _shall be_--leagued","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13505",345,"with your enemy against you.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13506",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13507",345,"""One more request;"" she became very solemn as she said this, ""it is not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13508",345,"vital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13509",345,"me, if you will."" We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no need","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13510",345,"to speak:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13511",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13512",345,"""I want you to read the Burial Service."" She was interrupted by a deep","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13513",345,"groan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13514",345,"heart, and continued: ""You must read it over me some day. Whatever may","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13515",345,"be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13516",345,"thought to all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13517",345,"then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever--come what may!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13518",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13519",345,"""But oh, my dear one,"" he pleaded, ""death is afar off from you.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13520",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13521",345,"""Nay,"" she said, holding up a warning hand. ""I am deeper in death at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13522",345,"this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13523",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13524",345,"""Oh, my wife, must I read it?"" he said, before he began.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13525",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13526",345,"""It would comfort me, my husband!"" was all she said; and he began to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13527",345,"read when she had got the book ready.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13528",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13529",345,"""How can I--how could any one--tell of that strange scene, its","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13530",345,"solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13531",345,"sweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13532",345,"truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13533",345,"had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13534",345,"round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13535",345,"her husband's voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13536",345,"had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13550",345,"_15 October, Varna._--We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13551",345,"got to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13552",345,"Orient Express. We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13553",345,"o'clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13554",345,"arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel--""the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13555",345,"Odessus."" The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13556",345,"to get on, to care for them. Until the _Czarina Catherine_ comes into","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13557",345,"port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13558",345,"Thank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13559",345,"coming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she slept","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13560",345,"nearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13561",345,"wakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13562",345,"hypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13563",345,"had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13564",345,"habit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13565",345,"these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13566",345,"always asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13567",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13568",345,"""Nothing; all is dark."" And to the second:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13570",345,"""I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13571",345,"by. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13572",345,"high--I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13573",345,"It is evident that the _Czarina Catherine_ is still at sea, hastening on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13574",345,"her way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had four","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13575",345,"telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect:","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13576",345,"that the _Czarina Catherine_ had not been reported to Lloyd's from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13577",345,"anywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13578",345,"send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13579",345,"was to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13580",345,"sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13581",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13582",345,"We had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13584",345,"as soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13585",345,"on the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13586",345,"form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13587",345,"so cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man's form without","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13588",345,"suspicion--which he evidently wishes to avoid--he must remain in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13589",345,"box. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13590",345,"for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13591",345,"before he wakes. What mercy he shall get from us will not count for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13592",345,"much. We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13593",345,"seamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13594",345,"and we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13609",345,"the Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13610",345,"he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13611",345,"a friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13612",345,"risk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13613",345,"facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13614",345,"similar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13615",345,"was much impressed with Godalming's kindly manner to him, and we are all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13616",345,"satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13617",345,"have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13618",345,"Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13619",345,"drive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13620",345,"prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13621",345,"have ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count's body,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13622",345,"it will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13653",345,"Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13658",345,"in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13662",345,"would break poor Harker's heart--certainly his nerve--if he knew that we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13663",345,"had even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13853",345,"forgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13854",345,"of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13855",345,"brightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13885",345,"a study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not--not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13886",345,"but once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari ad","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13888",345,"in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13889",345,"from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_. That is to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13950",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13951",345,"""He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"13988",345,"night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13989",345,"had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13990",345,"and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13991",345,"for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13992",345,"Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13993",345,"more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13994",345,"necessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13995",345,"this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13996",345,"resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13997",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13998",345,"""I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"13999",345,"steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14000",345,"men's voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14001",345,"the rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14002",345,"There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14003",345,"along. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14004",345,"blowing upon me.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14005",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14006",345,"Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14007",345,"on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14008",345,"weight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14009",345,"Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14010",345,"Harker's hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14011",345,"was a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14012",345,"passing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14013",345,"sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14014",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14015",345,"""Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!"" We","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14016",345,"could only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to get","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14017",345,"tea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14018",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14019",345,"""You see, my friends. _He_ is close to land: he has left his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14020",345,"earth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14021",345,"hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14022",345,"not touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14023",345,"in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14024",345,"at Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14025",345,"be carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14026",345,"may discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14027",345,"shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14028",345,"We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14029",345,"on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14030",345,"true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14031",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14032",345,"There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14033",345,"at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14034",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14035",345,"Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14036",345,"response in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14037",345,"than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14038",345,"so short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14039",345,"soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14040",345,"reply:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14041",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14042",345,"""All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14043",345,"of wood on wood."" She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14044",345,"to-night.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14045",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14046",345,"And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14047",345,"expectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14048",345,"but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14049",345,"possibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14050",345,"hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14051",345,"more light on what is happening.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14055",345,"_Later._--Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14056",345,"there was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14057",345,"station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14058",345,"Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14059",345,"this morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14060",345,"sensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14061",345,"her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14062",345,"hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14063",345,"on it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count's power","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14064",345,"over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14065",345,"a happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14066",345,"speak, her words were enigmatical:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14067",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14068",345,"""Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14069",345,"hear, far off, confused sounds--as of men talking in strange tongues,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14070",345,"fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves."" She stopped and a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14071",345,"shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14072",345,"till, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14172",345,"frae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14183",345,"The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14187",345,"property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14188",345,"river Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14189",345,"fling in, and as it was marked Galatz _via_ Varna, I thocht I'd let it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14190",345,"lie till we discharged in the port an' get rid o't althegither. We","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14191",345,"didn't do much clearin' that day, an' had to remain the nicht at anchor;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14192",345,"but in the mornin', braw an' airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14193",345,"aboard wi' an order, written to him from England, to receive a box","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14194",345,"marked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14202",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14203",345,"""I'll be tellin' ye quick!"" he answered, and, stepping down to his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14204",345,"cabin, produced a receipt signed ""Immanuel Hildesheim."" Burgen-strasse","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14205",345,"16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14206",345,"with thanks we came away.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14207",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14208",345,"We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14209",345,"Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14210",345,"pointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with a little","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14211",345,"bargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14212",345,"important. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14213",345,"him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14214",345,"which would arrive at Galatz in the _Czarina Catherine_. This he was to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14215",345,"give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14216",345,"who traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14217",345,"an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14218",345,"International Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14219",345,"the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14220",345,"he knew.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14221",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14222",345,"We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14223",345,"neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14224",345,"gone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14225",345,"his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14226",345,"together with the rent due, in English money. This had been between ten","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14227",345,"and eleven o'clock last night. We were at a standstill again.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14228",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14229",345,"Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14230",345,"the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14231",345,"St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14232",345,"animal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14233",345,"women crying out ""This is the work of a Slovak!"" We hurried away lest we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14234",345,"should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14235",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14236",345,"As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14237",345,"convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14314",345,"what he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14315",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14316",345,"3. _By Water._--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14317",345,"danger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; even","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14318",345,"then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14319",345,"he wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14320",345,"indeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14321",345,"unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14322",345,"still be desperate.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14323",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14324",345,"We know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14325",345,"is to ascertain _what_ water.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14326",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14327",345,"The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14328",345,"then, get a light on what his later task is to be.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14329",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14330",345,"_Firstly._--We must differentiate between what he did in London as part","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14331",345,"of his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14332",345,"to arrange as best he could.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14333",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14334",345,"_Secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14335",345,"know of, what he has done here.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14336",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14337",345,"As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14338",345,"invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14339",345,"exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14340",345,"The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14341",345,"Hildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_. There is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14342",345,"also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14343",345,"there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14344",345,"Hildesheim.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14345",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14346",345,"That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The _Czarina Catherine_","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14347",345,"made a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14348",345,"suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14349",345,"played the Count's game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14350",345,"through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14351",345,"Count's arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14352",345,"the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it--and here","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14353",345,"we lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14354",345,"moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14355",345,"avoided.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14356",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14357",345,"Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival--_on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14358",345,"land_, at Galatz.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14359",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14360",345,"The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14361",345,"appear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14362",345,"aid in the work? In my husband's diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14363",345,"with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14364",345,"remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14365",345,"feeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14366",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14367",345,"My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14368",345,"castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14369",345,"the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14370",345,"who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14371",345,"Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14372",345,"service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14373",345,"came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14374",345,"arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14375",345,"he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14376",345,"by murdering his agent.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14377",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14378",345,"I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14379",345,"Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14380",345,"the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14381",345,"level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14382",345,"was on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14383",345,"poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14384",345,"would be no such sound if floating down stream.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14385",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14386",345,"Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14387",345,"possibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14388",345,"easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14389",345,"which runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14390",345,"close to Dracula's castle as can be got by water.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14401",345,"him by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14402",345,"is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14403",345,"him may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14416",345,"they carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14417",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14418",345,"""I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14419",345,"there may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some other","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14420",345,"precautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14421",345,"not quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points."" Dr.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14422",345,"Seward said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14423",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14424",345,"""I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14425",345,"together, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14426",345,"along. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14427",345,"Slovaks, and a chance thrust--for I don't suppose these fellows carry","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14428",345,"guns--would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time; we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14429",345,"shall not rest until the Count's head and body have been separated, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14430",345,"we are sure that he cannot re-incarnate."" He looked at Jonathan as he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14431",345,"spoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14432",345,"torn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14433",345,"boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ...","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14434",345,"the ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14435",345,"silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14436",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14437",345,"""Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14438",345,"are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14439",345,"last; and again that it is your right to destroy him--that--which has","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14440",345,"wrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14441",345,"will be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14442",345,"once; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14443",345,"fight with lethal weapons. But I can be of other service; I can fight in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14444",345,"other way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now let","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14445",345,"me say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14446",345,"friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14447",345,"whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14448",345,"landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14449",345,"country. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14450",345,"stream whence he cannot escape to land--where he dares not raise the lid","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14451",345,"of his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14452",345,"perish--we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,--from Bistritz","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14453",345,"over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14454",345,"Mina's hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14455",345,"dark and unknown otherwise--after the first sunrise when we are near","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14456",345,"that fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14457",345,"made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated."" Here","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14458",345,"Jonathan interrupted him hotly:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14459",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14460",345,"""Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14461",345,"in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil's illness, right","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14462",345,"into the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven or","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14463",345,"Hell!"" He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14464",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14465",345,"""Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellish","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14466",345,"infamy--with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14467",345,"speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14468",345,"Have you felt the Vampire's lips upon your throat?"" Here he turned to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14469",345,"me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry:","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14470",345,"""Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!"" and he sank","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14471",345,"down on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor's voice, as he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14472",345,"spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14473",345,"us all:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14474",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14475",345,"""Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14476",345,"place that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14477",345,"place. There is work--wild work--to be done there, that her eyes may not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14478",345,"see. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14479",345,"is to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14480",345,"terrible straits. If the Count escape us this time--and he is strong and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14481",345,"subtle and cunning--he may choose to sleep him for a century, and then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14482",345,"in time our dear one""--he took my hand--""would come to him to keep him","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14483",345,"company, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14484",345,"told us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14485",345,"clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. You shudder; and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14486",345,"well may it be. Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14487",345,"necessary. My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14488",345,"possibly my life? If it were that any one went into that place to stay,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14497",345,"How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14499",345,"What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14501",345,"that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14502",345,"to spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14508",345,"all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. Professor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14509",345,"Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for Veresti,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14510",345,"where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14511",345,"bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14512",345,"horses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14513",345,"in the matter. The Professor knows something of a great many languages,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14514",345,"so we shall get on all right. We have all got arms, even for me a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14548",345,"be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14549",345,"Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14550",345,"they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14551",345,"lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14552",345,"of its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14553",345,"their spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14554",345,"they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14555",345,"after the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14556",345,"can mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14571",345,"a few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14580",345,"in our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, big","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14581",345,"and little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14582",345,"and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14583",345,"so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14584",345,"Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14585",345,"have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14586",345,"deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14587",345,"to ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14588",345,"going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14589",345,"was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14590",345,"boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14591",345,"we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14592",345,"night. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14593",345,"upon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14601",345,"was forgetting my trouble. It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14602",345,"so long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am a new","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14604",345,"all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14605",345,"keeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14695",345,"willingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14696",345,"changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14697",345,"think that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14698",345,"he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14699",345,"to make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14700",345,"off we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14701",345,"kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14702",345,"of nice qualities. They are _very, very_ superstitious. In the first","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14703",345,"house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14704",345,"forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14705",345,"keep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14706",345,"extra amount of garlic into our food; and I can't abide garlic. Ever","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14707",345,"since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14708",345,"escaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14709",345,"driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14710",345,"that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14711",345,"Professor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14712",345,"made me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14713",345,"says that I answered as usual ""darkness, lapping water and creaking","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14714",345,"wood""; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14715",345,"Jonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I write","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14745",345,"got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14746",345,"four-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14780",345,"unrecorded.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14781",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14782",345,"We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14783",345,"saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14784",345,"carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14785",345,"couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14786",345,"more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14787",345,"before, came the answer: ""darkness and the swirling of water."" Then she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14788",345,"woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14789",345,"At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14790",345,"guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14791",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14792",345,"""This is the way.""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14793",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14794",345,"""How know you it?"" I ask.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14795",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14796",345,"""Of course I know it,"" she answer, and with a pause, add: ""Have not my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14797",345,"Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?""","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14798",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14799",345,"At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14800",345,"such by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the coach","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14801",345,"road from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14802",345,"more of use.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14803",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14804",345,"So we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14805",345,"sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14806",345,"have fallen--the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14807",345,"they go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14808",345,"have note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14809",345,"hours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14810",345,"she succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14811",345,"suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14812",345,"not wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14813",345,"her; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14814",345,"all-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14815",345,"guilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14816",345,"reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14817",345,"look down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14818",345,"time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14819",345,"so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14820",345,"For we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14821",345,"it were the end of the world.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14822",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14823",345,"Then I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14824",345,"then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14825",345,"though I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14826",345,"myself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14827",345,"Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14828",345,"and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14829",345,"first enter the Count's house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14830",345,"is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14831",345,"light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14832",345,"prepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14833",345,"to feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I go","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14834",345,"to help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already--that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14835",345,"she was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14836",345,"grave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14837",345,"help me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14838",345,"fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14839",345,"of watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14840",345,"quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14841",345,"more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14842",345,"wake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14843",345,"obedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14844",345,"sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14845",345,"to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14846",345,"harnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she look","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14847",345,"in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14848",345,"not. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!--I am afraid of all things--even","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14849",345,"to think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14850",345,"death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"14855",345,"and I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14856",345,"that I, Van Helsing, am mad--that the many horrors and the so long","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14857",345,"strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14858",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14859",345,"All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14860",345,"moving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14861",345,"frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14862",345,"sometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14863",345,"did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her--even for food. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14864",345,"began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14865",345,"she is with that Vampire baptism. ""Well,"" said I to myself, ""if it be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14866",345,"that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14867",345,"night."" As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14868",345,"imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14869",345,"with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14870",345,"sleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowning","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14871",345,"mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14872",345,"steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14873",345,"of in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14874",345,"the end was near.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14875",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14876",345,"I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14877",345,"unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us--for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14878",345,"even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14879",345,"all was for a time in a great twilight--I took out the horses and fed","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14880",345,"them in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I make","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14881",345,"Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14882",345,"her rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14883",345,"she had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14884",345,"I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14885",345,"fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14886",345,"where Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14887",345,"I broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14888",345,"time--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14889",345,"snow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14890",345,"clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14891",345,"feet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14892",345,"she had grown more quiet:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14893",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14894",345,"""Will you not come over to the fire?"" for I wished to make a test of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14895",345,"what she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14896",345,"stopped, and stood as one stricken.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14897",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14898",345,"""Why not go on?"" I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14899",345,"down in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14900",345,"from sleep, she said simply:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14901",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14902",345,"""I cannot!"" and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14903",345,"could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14904",345,"danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14905",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14906",345,"Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14907",345,"came to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14908",345,"whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14909",345,"time. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14910",345,"the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14911",345,"with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14912",345,"about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14913",345,"sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14914",345,"some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14915",345,"snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14916",345,"trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14917",345,"whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14918",345,"fear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14919",345,"ring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14920",345,"the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14921",345,"all the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan's","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14922",345,"horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14923",345,"began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14924",345,"glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14925",345,"cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14926",345,"the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14927",345,"feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14928",345,"circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14929",345,"I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14930",345,"me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14931",345,"it was:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14932",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14933",345,"""No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!"" I turned to her, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14934",345,"looking in her eyes, said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14935",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14936",345,"""But you? It is for you that I fear!"" whereat she laughed--a laugh, low","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14937",345,"and unreal, and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14938",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14939",345,"""Fear for _me_! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14940",345,"than I am,"" and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14941",345,"wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14942",345,"Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14943",345,"wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14944",345,"the Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till--if God have not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14945",345,"take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before me","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14946",345,"in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14947",345,"they would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14948",345,"bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14949",345,"lips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14950",345,"through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14951",345,"her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14952",345,"of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14953",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14954",345,"""Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!"" In fear I turned to my poor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14955",345,"Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14956",345,"terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14957",345,"heart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14958",345,"seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14959",345,"Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14960",345,"laughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14961",345,"I knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14962",345,"approach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14963",345,"the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14964",345,"horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14965",345,"them softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14966",345,"beasts no more of terror.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14967",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14968",345,"And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14969",345,"snow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14970",345,"when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14971",345,"At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14972",345,"whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14973",345,"towards the castle, and were lost.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14974",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14975",345,"Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14976",345,"to hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14977",345,"could not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14978",345,"no response, none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14979",345,"made my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. To-day I have","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14980",345,"much to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14981",345,"may be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14982",345,"obscure it, will be to me a safety.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14983",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"14984",345,"I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"15017",345,"at all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I left","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15018",345,"Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15019",345,"The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15020",345,"useful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15021",345,"hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15022",345,"being entered I might not get out. Jonathan's bitter experience served","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15023",345,"me here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15024",345,"knew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15025",345,"there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15026",345,"there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15027",345,"Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"15030",345,"Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"15032",345,"resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15033",345,"submit, if it were God's will. At any rate it was only death and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15034",345,"freedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15035",345,"choice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15036",345,"the grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15037",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15038",345,"I knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that are","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15039",345,"inhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in her","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15040",345,"Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15041",345,"though I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15042",345,"such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15043",345,"found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15044",345,"and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15045",345,"wanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15046",345,"come, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15047",345,"woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15048",345,"kiss--and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"15050",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15051",345,"There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15052",345,"of such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15053",345,"heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15054",345,"as the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved--I, Van Helsing,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15055",345,"with all my purpose and with my motive for hate--I was moved to a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15056",345,"yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15057",345,"very soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15058",345,"strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15059",345,"was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15060",345,"to a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15061",345,"long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15062",345,"of a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15063",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15064",345,"Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15065",345,"away tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15066",345,"pause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15067",345,"begin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15068",345,"a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15069",345,"which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15070",345,"the mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15071",345,"exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15072",345,"some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15073",345,"with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear Madam","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15074",345,"Mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15075",345,"further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15076",345,"searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15077",345,"there had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15078",345,"night, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15079",345,"There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15080",345,"nobly proportioned. On it was but one word","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"15099",345,"fear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15100",345,"till all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"15104",345,"endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15105",345,"writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15106",345,"left my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15107",345,"now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15108",345,"for a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15109",345,"severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15110",345,"crumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15111",345,"centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud ""I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"15133",345,"_6 November._--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15134",345,"took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15135",345,"not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15136",345,"heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15137",345,"left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15138",345,"provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15139",345,"could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15140",345,"habitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15141",345,"walking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15142",345,"clear line of Dracula's castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15143",345,"the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15144",345,"Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15145",345,"perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15146",345,"seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15147",345,"on any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15148",345,"could hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15149",345,"sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15150",345,"full of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15151",345,"that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15152",345,"exposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15153",345,"could trace it through the drifted snow.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15154",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15155",345,"In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15156",345,"him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15157",345,"with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15158",345,"hand and drew me in: ""See!"" he said, ""here you will be in shelter; and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15159",345,"if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one."" He brought in our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15160",345,"furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15161",345,"forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15162",345,"repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15163",345,"not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15164",345,"reproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15165",345,"of the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15166",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15167",345,"""Look! Madam Mina, look! look!"" I sprang up and stood beside him on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15168",345,"rock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15169",345,"more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15170",345,"to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15171",345,"snow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15172",345,"were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15173",345,"white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15174",345,"kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15175",345,"off--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15176",345,"group of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15177",345,"long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog's tail","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15178",345,"wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15179",345,"snow as they were, I could see from the men's clothes that they were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15180",345,"peasants or gypsies of some kind.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15181",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15182",345,"On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15183",345,"felt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15184",345,"well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15185",345,"there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15186",345,"pursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15187",345,"however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15188",345,"the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15189",345,"night. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15190",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15191",345,"""At least you shall be safe here from _him_!"" He took the glasses from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15192",345,"me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15193",345,"""See,"" he said, ""they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15194",345,"galloping as hard as they can."" He paused and went on in a hollow","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15195",345,"voice:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15196",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15197",345,"""They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God's will be","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15198",345,"done!"" Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15199",345,"landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15200",345,"glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15201",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15202",345,"""Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15203",345,"south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15204",345,"blots it all out!"" I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15205",345,"and Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15206",345,"At the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking around","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15207",345,"I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15208",345,"break-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15209",345,"of course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15210",345,"the cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15211",345,"and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15212",345,"laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15213",345,"opening of our shelter. ""They are all converging,"" he said. ""When the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15214",345,"time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides."" I got out my revolver","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15215",345,"ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15216",345,"louder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15217",345,"It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15218",345,"and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15219",345,"towards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15220",345,"see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15221",345,"numbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15222",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15223",345,"Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15224",345,"fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15225",345,"circling eddies. At times we could not see an arm's length before us;","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15226",345,"but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15227",345,"clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15228",345,"late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15229",345,"with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15230",345,"sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15231",345,"than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15232",345,"bodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15233",345,"and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15234",345,"had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15235",345,"the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15236",345,"party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15237",345,"not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15238",345,"seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15239",345,"and lower on the mountain tops.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"15247",345,"raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris' strong resolute","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15248",345,"tone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15249",345,"there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15250",345,"spoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15251",345,"and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15252",345,"other. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15253",345,"horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15254",345,"companions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15255",345,"forward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15256",345,"unmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15257",345,"Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15258",345,"Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15259",345,"up. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15260",345,"gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15261",345,"himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15262",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15263",345,"The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15264",345,"front, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15265",345,"tops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15266",345,"For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15267",345,"and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15268",345,"Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15269",345,"upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15270",345,"surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15271",345,"parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15272",345,"formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15273",345,"shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15274",345,"order.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15275",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15276",345,"In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15277",345,"of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15278",345,"evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15279",345,"should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15280",345,"levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15281",345,"the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15282",345,"attention. Jonathan's impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15283",345,"purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15284",345,"cowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15285",345,"cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15286",345,"box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15287",345,"Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15288",345,"Szgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15289",345,"with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15290",345,"seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15291",345,"they cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15292",345,"I thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15293",345,"beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15294",345,"with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15295",345,"spurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15296",345,"as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15297",345,"attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15298",345,"the other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15299",345,"lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15300",345,"the top of the box was thrown back.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15301",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15302",345,"By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15303",345,"and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15304",345,"no resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15305",345,"shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15306",345,"lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15307",345,"the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15308",345,"image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15309",345,"knew too well.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15310",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15311",345,"As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15312",345,"turned to triumph.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15313",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15314",345,"But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan's great knife.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15315",345,"I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15316",345,"moment Mr. Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15317",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15318",345,"It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15319",345,"drawing of a breath, the whole body crumble into dust and passed from","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"15322",345,"I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"15325",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15326",345,"The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15327",345,"of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"15329",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15330",345,"The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15331",345,"disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15332",345,"if for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15333",345,"leiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves,","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15334",345,"which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15335",345,"us alone.","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15336",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15337",345,"Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15338",345,"hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15339",345,"flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15340",345,"two doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15341",345,"head on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15342",345,"in that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15343",345,"my heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15344",345,"","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15345",345,"""I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!"" he cried","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15346",345,"suddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, ""It was","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"15352",345,"as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"
"15353",345,"spoke:--","Stoker, Bram","Dracula"

"15552",6087,"ago, after having seen Ferney, to view this mansion. I trod the floors","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15553",6087,"with the same feelings of awe and respect as we did, together, those","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"15559",6087,"informed me that he retired to rest at three, got up at two, and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"15607",6087,"made numerous enquiries in the town concerning him, but can learn","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15608",6087,"nothing. He only went into society there once, when M. Pictet took him","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15609",6087,"to the house of a lady to spend the evening. They say he is a very","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15610",6087,"singular man, and seem to think him very uncivil. Amongst other things","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15611",6087,"they relate, that having invited M. Pictet and Bonstetten to dinner,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15612",6087,"he went on the lake to Chillon, leaving a gentleman who travelled with","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15613",6087,"him to receive them and make his apologies. Another evening, being","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15614",6087,"invited to the house of Lady D---- H----, he promised to attend,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15615",6087,"but upon approaching the windows of her ladyship's villa, and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15616",6087,"perceiving the room to be full of company, he set down his friend,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15617",6087,"desiring him to plead his excuse, and immediately returned home. This","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15618",6087,"will serve as a contradiction to the report which you tell me is","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15619",6087,"current in England, of his having been avoided by his countrymen on","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15620",6087,"the continent. The case happens to be directly the reverse, as he has","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15621",6087,"been generally sought by them, though on most occasions, apparently","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15622",6087,"without success. It is said, indeed, that upon paying his first visit","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15623",6087,"at Coppet, following the servant who had announced his name, he was","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15624",6087,"surprised to meet a lady carried out fainting; but before he had been","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15625",6087,"seated many minutes, the same lady, who had been so affected at the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15626",6087,"sound of his name, returned and conversed with him a considerable","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15627",6087,"time--such is female curiosity and affectation! He visited Coppet","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15628",6087,"frequently, and of course associated there with several of his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15629",6087,"countrymen, who evinced no reluctance to meet him whom his enemies","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15630",6087,"alone would represent as an outcast.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"15632",6087,"Though I have been so unsuccessful in this town, I have been more","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15633",6087,"fortunate in my enquiries elsewhere. There is a society three or four","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15634",6087,"miles from Geneva, the centre of which is the Countess of Breuss, a","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15635",6087,"Russian lady, well acquainted with the agremens de la Societe, and who","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15636",6087,"has collected them round herself at her mansion. It was chiefly here,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15637",6087,"I find, that the gentleman who travelled with Lord Byron, as","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15638",6087,"physician, sought for society. He used almost every day to cross the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15639",6087,"lake by himself, in one of their flat-bottomed boats, and return after","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15640",6087,"passing the evening with his friends, about eleven or twelve at night,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15641",6087,"often whilst the storms were raging in the circling summits of the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15642",6087,"mountains around. As he became intimate, from long acquaintance, with","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15643",6087,"several of the families in this neighbourhood, I have gathered from","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15644",6087,"their accounts some excellent traits of his lordship's character,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15645",6087,"which I will relate to you at some future opportunity. I must,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15646",6087,"however, free him from one imputation attached to him--of having in","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15647",6087,"his house two sisters as the partakers of his revels. This is, like","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15648",6087,"many other charges which have been brought against his lordship,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15649",6087,"entirely destitute of truth. His only companion was the physician I","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15650",6087,"have already mentioned. The report originated from the following","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15651",6087,"circumstance: Mr. Percy Bysshe Shelly, a gentleman well known for","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15652",6087,"extravagance of doctrine, and for his daring, in their profession,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15653",6087,"even to sign himself with the title of ATHeos in the Album at","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"15658",6087,"truth of which is here positively denied.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"15660",6087,"Among other things which the lady, from whom I procured these","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15661",6087,"anecdotes, related to me, she mentioned the outline of a ghost story","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15662",6087,"by Lord Byron. It appears that one evening Lord B., Mr. P. B. Shelly,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15663",6087,"the two ladies and the gentleman before alluded to, after having","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15664",6087,"perused a German work, which was entitled Phantasmagoriana, began","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15665",6087,"relating ghost stories; when his lordship having recited the beginning","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15666",6087,"of Christabel, then unpublished, the whole took so strong a hold of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15667",6087,"Mr. Shelly's mind, that he suddenly started up and ran out of the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"15669",6087,"leaning against a mantle-piece, with cold drops of perspiration","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15670",6087,"trickling down his face. After having given him something to refresh","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"15895",6087,"his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15896",6087,"to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15897",6087,"romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15898",6087,"than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15899",6087,"attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15900",6087,"always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15901",6087,"were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15902",6087,"---- Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"15909",6087,"whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15910",6087,"pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15911",6087,"carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15912",6087,"his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15913",6087,"proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15914",6087,"who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15915",6087,"accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15916",6087,"","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15917",6087,"Hitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15918",6087,"character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15919",6087,"were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15920",6087,"from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15921",6087,"in his liberality;--the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15922",6087,"from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15923",6087,"Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15924",6087,"reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15925",6087,"that he bestowed his alms;--these were sent from the door with","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15926",6087,"hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15927",6087,"something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15928",6087,"lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15929",6087,"with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15930",6087,"importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15931",6087,"bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15932",6087,"the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15933",6087,"mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15934",6087,"was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15935",6087,"sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15936",6087,"towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15937",6087,"eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15938",6087,"fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15939",6087,"table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15940",6087,"known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15941",6087,"gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15942",6087,"generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15943",6087,"encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15944",6087,"numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law--this","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15945",6087,"apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15946",6087,"with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15947",6087,"half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15948",6087,"torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15949",6087,"dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend;","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15950",6087,"whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15951",6087,"hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15952",6087,"wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15953",6087,"he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15954",6087,"ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15955",6087,"convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15956",6087,"certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15957",6087,"combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15958",6087,"represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15959",6087,"pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15960",6087,"profit;--but he delayed it--for each day he hoped his friend would","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15961",6087,"give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him;","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15962",6087,"however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15963",6087,"the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15964",6087,"eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15965",6087,"his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15966",6087,"constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15967",6087,"his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15968",6087,"supernatural.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15969",6087,"","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15970",6087,"They soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15971",6087,"companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15972",6087,"an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15973",6087,"another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15974",6087,"arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15975",6087,"was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15976",6087,"from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15977",6087,"entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15978",6087,"his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15979",6087,"belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15980",6087,"friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15981",6087,"the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15982",6087,"licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15983",6087,"that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15984",6087,"her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15985",6087,"that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15986",6087,"pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15987",6087,"degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15988",6087,"apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15989",6087,"thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15990",6087,"deformity of their vices to the public gaze.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15991",6087,"","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15992",6087,"Aubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15993",6087,"a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15994",6087,"some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15995",6087,"the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15996",6087,"circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15997",6087,"soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15998",6087,"inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"15999",6087,"frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16000",6087,"with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16001",6087,"secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16002",6087,"discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16003",6087,"likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16004",6087,"no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16005",6087,"him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16006",6087,"time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16007",6087,"Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16008",6087,"all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16009",6087,"he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16010",6087,"immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16011",6087,"decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16012",6087,"tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16013",6087,"upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16014",6087,"with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16015",6087,"Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16016",6087,"sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16017",6087,"did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16018",6087,"interposition.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16019",6087,"","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16020",6087,"Having left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16021",6087,"crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16022",6087,"his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16023",6087,"tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16024",6087,"apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16025",6087,"slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16026",6087,"coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16027",6087,"beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16028",6087,"painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16029",6087,"faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16030",6087,"for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16031",6087,"she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16032",6087,"would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16033",6087,"would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16034",6087,"for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16035",6087,"of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16036",6087,"his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16037",6087,"engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16038",6087,"of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"16046",6087,"describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?--It was","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16047",6087,"innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16048",6087,"stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16049",6087,"preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16050",6087,"watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16051",6087,"native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"16057",6087,"narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"16077",6087,"Aubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16078",6087,"so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16079",6087,"had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16080",6087,"ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16081",6087,"uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16082",6087,"to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16083",6087,"from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16084",6087,"depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16085",6087,"always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16086",6087,"him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16087",6087,"rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16088",6087,"love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16089",6087,"She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16090",6087,"she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16091",6087,"haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16092",6087,"some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16093",6087,"had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16094",6087,"with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16095",6087,"the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16096",6087,"his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16097",6087,"heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16098",6087,"return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16099",6087,"Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16100",6087,"consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16101",6087,"their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16102",6087,"impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16103",6087,"their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16104",6087,"when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16105",6087,"infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16106",6087,"freeze, he was silent.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16107",6087,"","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16108",6087,"Next morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16109",6087,"surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16110",6087,"concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16111",6087,"fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16112",6087,"depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16113",6087,"him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16114",6087,"in action;--he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16115",6087,"research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16116",6087,"that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16117",6087,"climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16118",6087,"rage upon the devoted country.--He at last, however, mounted his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16119",6087,"horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16120",6087,"late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown;","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16121",6087,"immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16122",6087,"the power of the storm was above--its echoing thunders had scarcely","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16123",6087,"an interval of rest--its thick heavy rain forced its way through the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16124",6087,"canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16125",6087,"radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16126",6087,"carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16127",6087,"animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16128",6087,"of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16129",6087,"lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16130",6087,"surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16131",6087,"guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16132",6087,"pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16133",6087,"silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16134",6087,"with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16135",6087,"unbroken sound;--he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16136",6087,"again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16137",6087,"door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16138",6087,"however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16139",6087,"called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16140",6087,"found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized;","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16141",6087,"when a voice cried, ""Again baffled!"" to which a loud laugh succeeded;","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16142",6087,"and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman:","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16143",6087,"determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16144",6087,"it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16145",6087,"force against the ground:--his enemy threw himself upon him, and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16146",6087,"kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat--when","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16147",6087,"the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16148",6087,"light in the day, disturbed him;--he instantly rose, and, leaving his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16149",6087,"prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16150",6087,"branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16151",6087,"was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16152",6087,"those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16153",6087,"mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16154",6087,"flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16155",6087,"attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16156",6087,"was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16157",6087,"him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16158",6087,"lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16159",6087,"arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16160",6087,"form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16161",6087,"colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16162",6087,"stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16163",6087,"that once dwelt there:--upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16164",6087,"her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:--to this","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16165",6087,"the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, ""A","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16166",6087,"Vampyre! a Vampyre!"" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16167",6087,"by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16168",6087,"bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16169",6087,"died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were--his mind was","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16170",6087,"benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16171",6087,"vacancy--he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16172",6087,"particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16173",6087,"soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16174",6087,"her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16175",6087,"approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16176",6087,"catastrophe. --To describe their grief would be impossible; but when","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16177",6087,"they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16178",6087,"Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16179",6087,"broken-hearted.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16180",6087,"","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16181",6087,"Aubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16182",6087,"often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16183",6087,"and upon Ianthe--by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16184",6087,"of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16185",6087,"would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16186",6087,"destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16187",6087,"and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16188",6087,"immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16189",6087,"attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16190",6087,"horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16191",6087,"combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16192",6087,"implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16193",6087,"separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16194",6087,"he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16195",6087,"quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16196",6087,"astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16197",6087,"he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16198",6087,"perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16199",6087,"was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16200",6087,"of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16201",6087,"this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16202",6087,"recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16203",6087,"waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16204",6087,"those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;--indeed, he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16205",6087,"appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16206",6087,"","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16207",6087,"Aubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16208",6087,"of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16209",6087,"for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16210",6087,"Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16211",6087,"it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16212",6087,"had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side--if he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16213",6087,"sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16214",6087,"the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16215",6087,"round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16216",6087,"throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16217",6087,"every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16218",6087,"He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16219",6087,"tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16220",6087,"visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16221",6087,"every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16222",6087,"be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16223",6087,"they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16224",6087,"robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16225",6087,"imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16226",6087,"to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16227",6087,"dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16228",6087,"inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16229",6087,"more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16230",6087,"narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16231",6087,"large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16232",6087,"they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16233",6087,"whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16234",6087,"by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16235",6087,"report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16236",6087,"placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16237",6087,"whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16238",6087,"example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16239",6087,"defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16240",6087,"insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16241",6087,"slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16242",6087,"the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16243",6087,"enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16244",6087,"received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16245",6087,"Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16246",6087,"or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16247",6087,"around him--his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16248",6087,"immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16249",6087,"","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16250",6087,"By promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16251",6087,"wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16252",6087,"ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence--they being","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16253",6087,"content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16254",6087,"with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16255",6087,"strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16256",6087,"death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16257",6087,"had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16258",6087,"the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16259",6087,"mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16260",6087,"who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16261",6087,"earnestness--""Assist me! you may save me--you may do more than","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16262",6087,"that--I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16263",6087,"as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"16274",6087,"their sockets: ""I swear!"" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16275",6087,"pillow, and breathed no more.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16276",6087,"","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16277",6087,"Aubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16278",6087,"attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16279",6087,"knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16280",6087,"him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16281",6087,"Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16282",6087,"he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16283",6087,"it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16284",6087,"upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16285",6087,"to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16286",6087,"the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16287",6087,"astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16288",6087,"it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16289",6087,"he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16290",6087,"robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16291",6087,"laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16292",6087,"he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16293",6087,"sake of the clothes.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16294",6087,"","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16295",6087,"Weary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16296",6087,"and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16297",6087,"melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16298",6087,"soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16299",6087,"Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16300",6087,"he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16301",6087,"was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16302",6087,"to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16303",6087,"ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16304",6087,"what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16305",6087,"same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut--he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16306",6087,"shuddered--hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16307",6087,"his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16308",6087,"peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16309",6087,"need no further certainty--they seemed gazing to be bound to the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16310",6087,"dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16311",6087,"the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16312",6087,"splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16313",6087,"of blood on each.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16314",6087,"","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16315",6087,"He left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16316",6087,"concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16317",6087,"seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16318",6087,"and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16319",6087,"Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16320",6087,"was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16321",6087,"Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16322",6087,"in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16323",6087,"life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16324",6087,"seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores;","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16325",6087,"and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16326",6087,"moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16327",6087,"all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16328",6087,"gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16329",6087,"still more attaching as a companion.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16330",6087,"","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16331",6087,"Miss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16332",6087,"applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16333",6087,"brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16334",6087,"apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16335",6087,"beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16336",6087,"arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16337",6087,"indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16338",6087,"light footing, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16339",6087,"attract--it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16340",6087,"brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16341",6087,"his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16342",6087,"destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16343",6087,"voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,--that face were then playing","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16344",6087,"in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16345",6087,"and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16346",6087,"guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16347",6087,"brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16348",6087,"It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16349",6087,"fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the ""busy","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16350",6087,"scene."" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16351",6087,"fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16352",6087,"not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16353",6087,"his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16354",6087,"determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16355",6087,"sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16356",6087,"which had been announced as a drawing-room.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16357",6087,"","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16358",6087,"The crowd was excessive--a drawing-room had not been held for a long","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16359",6087,"time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16360",6087,"hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16361",6087,"standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16362",6087,"in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16363",6087,"that very place--he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16364",6087,"voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear--""Remember your","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16365",6087,"oath."" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16366",6087,"that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16367",6087,"same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16368",6087,"entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16369",6087,"their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16370",6087,"a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16371",6087,"was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16372",6087,"hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16373",6087,"from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him--circumstances started","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16374",6087,"up in dreadful array--the dagger--his oath.--He roused himself, he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16375",6087,"could not believe it possible--the dead rise again!--He thought his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16376",6087,"imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16377",6087,"was impossible that it could be real--he determined, therefore, to","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16378",6087,"go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16379",6087,"Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16380",6087,"gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16381",6087,"assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16382",6087,"matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16383",6087,"devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16384",6087,"roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16385",6087,"by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16386",6087,"and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16387",6087,"and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16388",6087,"forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16389",6087,"towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16390",6087,"of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16391",6087,"in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16392",6087,"him--""Remember your oath!""--He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16393",6087,"sister, soon reached home.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16394",6087,"","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16395",6087,"Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16396",6087,"by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16397",6087,"the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16398",6087,"His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16399",6087,"intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16400",6087,"only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16401",6087,"thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him;--was he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16402",6087,"then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16403",6087,"amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16404",6087,"might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16405",6087,"and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16406",6087,"employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16407",6087,"death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16408",6087,"this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16409",6087,"sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16410",6087,"her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16411",6087,"stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16412",6087,"street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16413",6087,"neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16414",6087,"the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16415",6087,"returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16416",6087,"to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16417",6087,"safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16418",6087,"him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any--from thought. His","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16419",6087,"conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16420",6087,"by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16421",6087,"whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16422",6087,"into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16423",6087,"his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16424",6087,"entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16425",6087,"striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16426",6087,"last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16427",6087,"society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16428",6087,"proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16429",6087,"fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16430",6087,"time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16431",6087,"them by Aubrey's parents.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16432",6087,"","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16433",6087,"Desirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"16435",6087,"the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16436",6087,"engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16437",6087,"him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16438",6087,"absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16439",6087,"great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16440",6087,"for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16441",6087,"had attained a glassy lustre;--the only sign of affection and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16442",6087,"recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister;","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16443",6087,"then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16444",6087,"severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. ""Oh, do","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16445",6087,"not touch him--if your love for me is aught, do not go near him!""","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16446",6087,"When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16447",6087,"""True! true!"" and again he sank into a state, whence not even she could","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16448",6087,"rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16449",6087,"was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16450",6087,"off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16451",6087,"several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"16458",6087,"Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16459",6087,"whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16460",6087,"he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16461",6087,"Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"16463",6087,"intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16464",6087,"sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16465",6087,"him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16466",6087,"influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16467",6087,"kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16468",6087,"brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"16473",6087,"monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16474",6087,"a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16475",6087,"why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16476",6087,"as if he did not understand her--then seizing her hands, and gazing","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16477",6087,"on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16478",6087,"that she would never wed this monster, for he----  But he could not","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"16481",6087,"but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16482",6087,"heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder,","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16483",6087,"entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"16501",6087,"had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"16503",6087,"use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"16511",6087,"to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16512",6087,"given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"16521",6087,"easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation.","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16522",6087,"Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"16526",6087,"was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16527",6087,"where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16528",6087,"perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"
"16529",6087,"force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the","Polidori, John William","The Vampyre; a Tale"

"16852",10007,"story of the castle, with a steep oak roof. I can't have been more than","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16853",10007,"six years old, when one night I awoke, and looking round the room from","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16854",10007,"my bed, failed to see the nursery maid. Neither was my nurse there; and","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16855",10007,"I thought myself alone. I was not frightened, for I was one of those","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16856",10007,"happy children who are studiously kept in ignorance of ghost stories, of","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16857",10007,"fairy tales, and of all such lore as makes us cover up our heads when","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16858",10007,"the door cracks suddenly, or the flicker of an expiring candle makes the","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16859",10007,"shadow of a bedpost dance upon the wall, nearer to our faces. I was","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16860",10007,"vexed and insulted at finding myself, as I conceived, neglected, and I","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16861",10007,"began to whimper, preparatory to a hearty bout of roaring; when to my","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16862",10007,"surprise, I saw a solemn, but very pretty face looking at me from the","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16863",10007,"side of the bed. It was that of a young lady who was kneeling, with her","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16864",10007,"hands under the coverlet. I looked at her with a kind of pleased wonder,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16865",10007,"and ceased whimpering. She caressed me with her hands, and lay down","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16866",10007,"beside me on the bed, and drew me towards her, smiling; I felt","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16867",10007,"immediately delightfully soothed, and fell asleep again. I was wakened","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16868",10007,"by a sensation as if two needles ran into my breast very deep at the","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16869",10007,"same moment, and I cried loudly. The lady started back, with her eyes","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16870",10007,"fixed on me, and then slipped down upon the floor, and, as I thought,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16871",10007,"hid herself under the bed.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"16875",10007,"hearing my story, they made light of it, soothing me all they could","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16876",10007,"meanwhile. But, child as I was, I could perceive that their faces were","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16877",10007,"pale with an unwonted look of anxiety, and I saw them look under the","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16878",10007,"bed, and about the room, and peep under tables and pluck open cupboards;","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16879",10007,"and the housekeeper whispered to the nurse: ""Lay your hand along that","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"16893",10007,"slightly pitted with smallpox, and his chestnut wig. For a good while,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16894",10007,"every second day, he came and gave me medicine, which of course I hated.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"16901",10007,"very heartily at one of the answers; and patting me on the shoulder, and","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16902",10007,"kissing me, and telling me not to be frightened, that it was nothing but","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"16907",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16908",10007,"I was a little consoled by the nursery maid's assuring me that it was","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"16915",10007,"talking a little to them, and very kindly to me; his face was very sweet","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16916",10007,"and gentle, and he told me they were going to pray, and joined my hands","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16917",10007,"together, and desired me to say, softly, while they were praying, ""Lord","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"16918",10007,"hear all good prayers for us, for Jesus' sake."" I think these were the","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"16927",10007,"aloud with an earnest quavering voice for, what appeared to me, a long","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17286",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17287",10007,"""She is absolutely beautiful,"" threw in Mademoiselle, who had peeped for","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17300",10007,"nodding and grinning derisively towards the ladies, with gleaming eyes","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17301",10007,"and large white eyeballs, and her teeth set as if in fury.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17330",10007,"in delicate health, and nervous, but not subject to any kind of","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17331",10007,"seizure--she volunteered that--nor to any illusion; being, in fact,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17341",10007,"whither we are traveling.' That is all she said. She spoke very pure","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17343",10007,"looking sternly, her eyes fixed on mine. I fancy she makes a great point","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17356",10007,"When the physician came down to the drawing room, it was to report very","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17357",10007,"favorably upon his patient. She was now sitting up, her pulse quite","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17358",10007,"regular, apparently perfectly well. She had sustained no injury, and the","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17359",10007,"little shock to her nerves had passed away quite harmlessly. There could","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17360",10007,"be no harm certainly in my seeing her, if we both wished it; and, with","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17361",10007,"this permission I sent, forthwith, to know whether she would allow me to","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17367",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17368",10007,"Our visitor lay in one of the handsomest rooms in the schloss. It was,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17369",10007,"perhaps, a little stately. There was a somber piece of tapestry opposite","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17370",10007,"the foot of the bed, representing Cleopatra with the asps to her bosom;","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17371",10007,"and other solemn classic scenes were displayed, a little faded, upon the","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17372",10007,"other walls. But there was gold carving, and rich and varied color","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17373",10007,"enough in the other decorations of the room, to more than redeem the","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17374",10007,"gloom of the old tapestry.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17375",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17376",10007,"There were candles at the bedside. She was sitting up; her slender","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17377",10007,"pretty figure enveloped in the soft silk dressing gown, embroidered with","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17378",10007,"flowers, and lined with thick quilted silk, which her mother had thrown","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17379",10007,"over her feet as she lay upon the ground.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17380",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17381",10007,"What was it that, as I reached the bedside and had just begun my little","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17382",10007,"greeting, struck me dumb in a moment, and made me recoil a step or two","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17383",10007,"from before her? I will tell you.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17384",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17385",10007,"I saw the very face which had visited me in my childhood at night, which","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17386",10007,"remained so fixed in my memory, and on which I had for so many years so","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17387",10007,"often ruminated with horror, when no one suspected of what I","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17388",10007,"was thinking.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17389",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17390",10007,"It was pretty, even beautiful; and when I first beheld it, wore the","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17392",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17393",10007,"But this almost instantly lighted into a strange fixed smile of","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17395",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17396",10007,"There was a silence of fully a minute, and then at length she spoke; I","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17398",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17399",10007,"""How wonderful!"" she exclaimed. ""Twelve years ago, I saw your face in a","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17401",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17402",10007,"""Wonderful indeed!"" I repeated, overcoming with an effort the horror","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17403",10007,"that had for a time suspended my utterances. ""Twelve years ago, in","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17404",10007,"vision or reality, I certainly saw you. I could not forget your face. It","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17406",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17407",10007,"Her smile had softened. Whatever I had fancied strange in it, was gone,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17408",10007,"and it and her dimpling cheeks were now delightfully pretty and","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17409",10007,"intelligent.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17410",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17411",10007,"I felt reassured, and continued more in the vein which hospitality","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17412",10007,"indicated, to bid her welcome, and to tell her how much pleasure her","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17413",10007,"accidental arrival had given us all, and especially what a happiness it","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17414",10007,"was to me.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17415",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17416",10007,"I took her hand as I spoke. I was a little shy, as lonely people are,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17417",10007,"but the situation made me eloquent, and even bold. She pressed my hand,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17418",10007,"she laid hers upon it, and her eyes glowed, as, looking hastily into","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17419",10007,"mine, she smiled again, and blushed.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17420",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17421",10007,"She answered my welcome very prettily. I sat down beside her, still","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17422",10007,"wondering; and she said:","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17423",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17424",10007,"""I must tell you my vision about you; it is so very strange that you and","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17426",10007,"have seen, I you and you me, looking as we do now, when of course we","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17427",10007,"both were mere children. I was a child, about six years old, and I awoke","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17428",10007,"from a confused and troubled dream, and found myself in a room, unlike","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17429",10007,"my nursery, wainscoted clumsily in some dark wood, and with cupboards","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17430",10007,"and bedsteads, and chairs, and benches placed about it. The beds were,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17431",10007,"I thought, all empty, and the room itself without anyone but myself in","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17432",10007,"it; and I, after looking about me for some time, and admiring especially","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17433",10007,"an iron candlestick with two branches, which I should certainly know","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17434",10007,"again, crept under one of the beds to reach the window; but as I got","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17435",10007,"from under the bed, I heard someone crying; and looking up, while I was","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17436",10007,"still upon my knees, I saw you--most assuredly you--as I see you now; a","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17437",10007,"beautiful young lady, with golden hair and large blue eyes, and","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17438",10007,"lips--your lips--you as you are here.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17439",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17442",10007,"up screaming. I was frightened, and slipped down upon the ground, and,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17443",10007,"it seemed to me, lost consciousness for a moment; and when I came to","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17444",10007,"myself, I was again in my nursery at home. Your face I have never","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17450",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17451",10007,"""I don't know which should be most afraid of the other,"" she said, again","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17452",10007,"smiling--""If you were less pretty I think I should be very much afraid","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17453",10007,"of you, but being as you are, and you and I both so young, I feel only","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17454",10007,"that I have made your acquaintance twelve years ago, and have already a","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17455",10007,"right to your intimacy; at all events it does seem as if we were","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17456",10007,"destined, from our earliest childhood, to be friends. I wonder whether","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17457",10007,"you feel as strangely drawn towards me as I do to you; I have never had","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17458",10007,"a friend--shall I find one now?"" She sighed, and her fine dark eyes","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17459",10007,"gazed passionately on me.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17460",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17461",10007,"Now the truth is, I felt rather unaccountably towards the beautiful","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17462",10007,"stranger. I did feel, as she said, ""drawn towards her,"" but there was","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17463",10007,"also something of repulsion. In this ambiguous feeling, however, the","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17464",10007,"sense of attraction immensely prevailed. She interested and won me; she","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17465",10007,"was so beautiful and so indescribably engaging.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17513",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17514",10007,"There were some that did not please me so well.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17515",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17516",10007,"She was above the middle height of women. I shall begin by describing","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17517",10007,"her.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17518",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17519",10007,"She was slender, and wonderfully graceful. Except that her movements","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17520",10007,"were languid--very languid--indeed, there was nothing in her appearance","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17521",10007,"to indicate an invalid. Her complexion was rich and brilliant; her","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17522",10007,"features were small and beautifully formed; her eyes large, dark, and","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17523",10007,"lustrous; her hair was quite wonderful, I never saw hair so","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17524",10007,"magnificently thick and long when it was down about her shoulders; I","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17525",10007,"have often placed my hands under it, and laughed with wonder at its","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17526",10007,"weight. It was exquisitely fine and soft, and in color a rich very dark","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17527",10007,"brown, with something of gold. I loved to let it down, tumbling with its","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17528",10007,"own weight, as, in her room, she lay back in her chair talking in her","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17529",10007,"sweet low voice, I used to fold and braid it, and spread it out and","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17530",10007,"play with it. Heavens! If I had but known all!","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17531",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17532",10007,"I said there were particulars which did not please me. I have told you","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17533",10007,"that her confidence won me the first night I saw her; but I found that","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17534",10007,"she exercised with respect to herself, her mother, her history,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17535",10007,"everything in fact connected with her life, plans, and people, an ever","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17536",10007,"wakeful reserve. I dare say I was unreasonable, perhaps I was wrong; I","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17537",10007,"dare say I ought to have respected the solemn injunction laid upon my","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17538",10007,"father by the stately lady in black velvet. But curiosity is a restless","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17539",10007,"and unscrupulous passion, and no one girl can endure, with patience,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17540",10007,"that hers should be baffled by another. What harm could it do anyone to","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17541",10007,"tell me what I so ardently desired to know? Had she no trust in my good","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17542",10007,"sense or honor? Why would she not believe me when I assured her, so","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17543",10007,"solemnly, that I would not divulge one syllable of what she told me to","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17544",10007,"any mortal breathing.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17545",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17546",10007,"There was a coldness, it seemed to me, beyond her years, in her smiling","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17547",10007,"melancholy persistent refusal to afford me the least ray of light.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17548",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17549",10007,"I cannot say we quarreled upon this point, for she would not quarrel","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17550",10007,"upon any. It was, of course, very unfair of me to press her, very","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17551",10007,"ill-bred, but I really could not help it; and I might just as well have","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17552",10007,"let it alone.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17553",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17554",10007,"What she did tell me amounted, in my unconscionable estimation--to","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17555",10007,"nothing.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17556",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17557",10007,"It was all summed up in three very vague disclosures:","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17558",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17559",10007,"First--Her name was Carmilla.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17560",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17561",10007,"Second--Her family was very ancient and noble.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17562",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17563",10007,"Third--Her home lay in the direction of the west.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17564",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17565",10007,"She would not tell me the name of her family, nor their armorial","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17566",10007,"bearings, nor the name of their estate, nor even that of the country","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17567",10007,"they lived in.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17568",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17569",10007,"You are not to suppose that I worried her incessantly on these subjects.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17570",10007,"I watched opportunity, and rather insinuated than urged my inquiries.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17571",10007,"Once or twice, indeed, I did attack her more directly. But no matter","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17572",10007,"what my tactics, utter failure was invariably the result. Reproaches and","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17573",10007,"caresses were all lost upon her. But I must add this, that her evasion","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17574",10007,"was conducted with so pretty a melancholy and deprecation, with so many,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17575",10007,"and even passionate declarations of her liking for me, and trust in my","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17576",10007,"honor, and with so many promises that I should at last know all, that I","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17577",10007,"could not find it in my heart long to be offended with her.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17578",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17579",10007,"She used to place her pretty arms about my neck, draw me to her, and","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17580",10007,"laying her cheek to mine, murmur with her lips near my ear, ""Dearest,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17581",10007,"your little heart is wounded; think me not cruel because I obey the","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17582",10007,"irresistible law of my strength and weakness; if your dear heart is","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17583",10007,"wounded, my wild heart bleeds with yours. In the rapture of my enormous","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17584",10007,"humiliation I live in your warm life, and you shall die--die, sweetly","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17585",10007,"die--into mine. I cannot help it; as I draw near to you, you, in your","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17586",10007,"turn, will draw near to others, and learn the rapture of that cruelty,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17587",10007,"which yet is love; so, for a while, seek to know no more of me and mine,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17588",10007,"but trust me with all your loving spirit.""","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17589",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17590",10007,"And when she had spoken such a rhapsody, she would press me more closely","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17591",10007,"in her trembling embrace, and her lips in soft kisses gently glow","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17592",10007,"upon my cheek.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17593",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17594",10007,"Her agitations and her language were unintelligible to me.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17595",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17596",10007,"From these foolish embraces, which were not of very frequent occurrence,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17597",10007,"I must allow, I used to wish to extricate myself; but my energies seemed","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17598",10007,"to fail me. Her murmured words sounded like a lullaby in my ear, and","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17599",10007,"soothed my resistance into a trance, from which I only seemed to recover","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17600",10007,"myself when she withdrew her arms.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17601",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17602",10007,"In these mysterious moods I did not like her. I experienced a strange","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17603",10007,"tumultuous excitement that was pleasurable, ever and anon, mingled with","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17604",10007,"a vague sense of fear and disgust. I had no distinct thoughts about her","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17605",10007,"while such scenes lasted, but I was conscious of a love growing into","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17606",10007,"adoration, and also of abhorrence. This I know is paradox, but I can","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17607",10007,"make no other attempt to explain the feeling.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17608",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17609",10007,"I now write, after an interval of more than ten years, with a trembling","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17610",10007,"hand, with a confused and horrible recollection of certain occurrences","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17611",10007,"and situations, in the ordeal through which I was unconsciously passing;","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17612",10007,"though with a vivid and very sharp remembrance of the main current of","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17613",10007,"my story.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17614",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17615",10007,"But, I suspect, in all lives there are certain emotional scenes, those","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17616",10007,"in which our passions have been most wildly and terribly roused, that","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17617",10007,"are of all others the most vaguely and dimly remembered.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17618",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17619",10007,"Sometimes after an hour of apathy, my strange and beautiful companion","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17620",10007,"would take my hand and hold it with a fond pressure, renewed again and","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17621",10007,"again; blushing softly, gazing in my face with languid and burning eyes,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17622",10007,"and breathing so fast that her dress rose and fell with the tumultuous","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17623",10007,"respiration. It was like the ardor of a lover; it embarrassed me; it was","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17624",10007,"hateful and yet over-powering; and with gloating eyes she drew me to","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17625",10007,"her, and her hot lips traveled along my cheek in kisses; and she would","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17626",10007,"whisper, almost in sobs, ""You are mine, you _shall_ be mine, you and I","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17627",10007,"are one for ever."" Then she had thrown herself back in her chair, with","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17628",10007,"her small hands over her eyes, leaving me trembling.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17629",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17630",10007,"""Are we related,"" I used to ask; ""what can you mean by all this? I","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17631",10007,"remind you perhaps of someone whom you love; but you must not, I hate","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17632",10007,"it; I don't know you--I don't know myself when you look so and talk so.""","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17633",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17634",10007,"She used to sigh at my vehemence, then turn away and drop my hand.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17635",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17636",10007,"Respecting these very extraordinary manifestations I strove in vain to","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17637",10007,"form any satisfactory theory--I could not refer them to affectation or","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17638",10007,"trick. It was unmistakably the momentary breaking out of suppressed","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17639",10007,"instinct and emotion. Was she, notwithstanding her mother's volunteered","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17640",10007,"denial, subject to brief visitations of insanity; or was there here a","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17641",10007,"disguise and a romance? I had read in old storybooks of such things.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17642",10007,"What if a boyish lover had found his way into the house, and sought to","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17643",10007,"prosecute his suit in masquerade, with the assistance of a clever old","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17644",10007,"adventuress. But there were many things against this hypothesis, highly","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17645",10007,"interesting as it was to my vanity.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17646",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17647",10007,"I could boast of no little attentions such as masculine gallantry","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17648",10007,"delights to offer. Between these passionate moments there were long","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17649",10007,"intervals of commonplace, of gaiety, of brooding melancholy, during","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17650",10007,"which, except that I detected her eyes so full of melancholy fire,","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17651",10007,"following me, at times I might have been as nothing to her. Except in","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17652",10007,"these brief periods of mysterious excitement her ways were girlish; and","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17653",10007,"there was always a languor about her, quite incompatible with a","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17654",10007,"masculine system in a state of health.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17655",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17656",10007,"In some respects her habits were odd. Perhaps not so singular in the","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17657",10007,"opinion of a town lady like you, as they appeared to us rustic people.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17658",10007,"She used to come down very late, generally not till one o'clock, she","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17659",10007,"would then take a cup of chocolate, but eat nothing; we then went out","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17660",10007,"for a walk, which was a mere saunter, and she seemed, almost","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17661",10007,"immediately, exhausted, and either returned to the schloss or sat on one","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17662",10007,"of the benches that were placed, here and there, among the trees. This","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17663",10007,"was a bodily languor in which her mind did not sympathize. She was","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17664",10007,"always an animated talker, and very intelligent.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17665",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17666",10007,"She sometimes alluded for a moment to her own home, or mentioned an","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17667",10007,"adventure or situation, or an early recollection, which indicated a","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17668",10007,"people of strange manners, and described customs of which we knew","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17669",10007,"nothing. I gathered from these chance hints that her native country was","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17670",10007,"much more remote than I had at first fancied.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17671",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17672",10007,"As we sat thus one afternoon under the trees a funeral passed us by. It","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17673",10007,"was that of a pretty young girl, whom I had often seen, the daughter of","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17674",10007,"one of the rangers of the forest. The poor man was walking behind the","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17675",10007,"coffin of his darling; she was his only child, and he looked quite","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17676",10007,"heartbroken.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17677",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17678",10007,"Peasants walking two-and-two came behind, they were singing a funeral","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17680",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17681",10007,"I rose to mark my respect as they passed, and joined in the hymn they","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17684",10007,"My companion shook me a little roughly, and I turned surprised.","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17685",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17686",10007,"She said brusquely, ""Don't you perceive how discordant that is?""","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17687",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17688",10007,"""I think it very sweet, on the contrary,"" I answered, vexed at the","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17689",10007,"interruption, and very uncomfortable, lest the people who composed the","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"17691",10007,"","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17692",10007,"I resumed, therefore, instantly, and was again interrupted. ""You pierce","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17693",10007,"my ears,"" said Carmilla, almost angrily, and stopping her ears with her","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17694",10007,"tiny fingers. ""Besides, how can you tell that your religion and mine are","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"17695",10007,"the same; your forms wound me, and I hate funerals. What a fuss! Why you","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"18231",10007,"about four or five feet long for it measured fully the length of the","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"18243",10007,"shoulders. A block of stone could not have been more still. There was","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"
"18244",10007,"not the slightest stir of respiration. As I stared at it, the figure","Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan","Carmilla"

"20015",22661,"day I was a priest of the Lord, occupied with prayer and sacred things;","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"

"20077",22661,"considerable distance from me and on the further side of the sanctuary","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20078",22661,"railing--a young woman of extraordinary beauty, and attired with royal","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20079",22661,"magnificence. It seemed as though scales had suddenly fallen from my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"

"20094",22661,"surrounded with such a penumbra as one beholds in gazing at the sun.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"

"20097",22661,"beauty into heaven itself, and thence brought back to earth the true","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20098",22661,"portrait of the Madonna, never in their delineations even approached","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20099",22661,"that wildly beautiful reality which I saw before me. Neither the verses","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20100",22661,"of the poet nor the palette of the artist could convey any conception","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20101",22661,"of her. She was rather tall, with a form and bearing of a goddess. Her","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20102",22661,"hair, of a soft blonde hue, was parted in the midst and flowed back over","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20103",22661,"her temples in two rivers of rippling gold; she seemed a diademed","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20104",22661,"queen. Her forehead, bluish-white in its transparency, extended its calm","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20105",22661,"breadth above the arches of her eyebrows, which by a strange singularity","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20106",22661,"were almost black, and admirably relieved the effect of sea-green eyes","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20107",22661,"of unsustainable vivacity and brilliancy. What eyes! With a single flash","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20108",22661,"they could have decided a man's destiny. They had a life, a limpidity,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20109",22661,"an ardour, a humid light which I have never seen in human eyes; they","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20110",22661,"shot forth rays like arrows, which I could distinctly _see_ enter my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20111",22661,"heart. I know not if the fire which illumined them came from heaven or","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20112",22661,"from hell, but assuredly it came from one or the other. That woman was","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20113",22661,"either an angel or a demon, perhaps both. Assuredly she never sprang","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20114",22661,"from the flank of Eve, our common mother. Teeth of the most lustrous","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20115",22661,"pearl gleamed in her ruddy smile, and at every inflection of her lips","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20116",22661,"little dimples appeared in the satiny rose of her adorable cheeks. There","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20117",22661,"was a delicacy and pride in the regal outline of her nostrils bespeaking","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20118",22661,"noble blood. Agate gleams played over the smooth lustrous skin of her","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20119",22661,"half-bare shoulders, and strings of great blonde pearls--almost equal","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20120",22661,"to her neck in beauty of colour--descended upon her bosom. From time","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20121",22661,"to time she elevated her head with the undulating grace of a startled","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20122",22661,"serpent or peacock, thereby imparting a quivering motion to the high","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20123",22661,"lace ruff which surrounded it like a silver trellis-work.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20124",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20125",22661,"She wore a robe of orange-red velvet, and from her wide ermine-lined","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20126",22661,"sleeves there peeped forth patrician hands of infinite delicacy, and so","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20127",22661,"ideally transparent that, like the fingers of Aurora, they permitted the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"

"20129",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20130",22661,"All these details I can recollect at this moment as plainly as though","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20131",22661,"they were of yesterday, for notwithstanding I was greatly troubled at","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20132",22661,"the time, nothing escaped me; the faintest touch of shading, the little","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20133",22661,"dark speck at the point of the chin, the imperceptible down at the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20134",22661,"corners of the lips, the velvety floss upon the brow, the quivering","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20135",22661,"shadows of the eyelashes upon the cheeks--I could notice everything with","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20136",22661,"astonishing lucidity of perception.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20137",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20138",22661,"And gazing I felt opening within me gates that had until then remained","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20139",22661,"closed; vents long obstructed became all clear, permitting glimpses of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20140",22661,"unfamiliar perspectives within; life suddenly made itself visible to me","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20141",22661,"under a totally novel aspect. I felt as though I had just been born into","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20142",22661,"a new world and a new order of things. A frightful anguish commenced to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20143",22661,"torture-my heart as with red-hot pincers. Every successive minute seemed","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20144",22661,"to me at once but a second and yet a century. Meanwhile the ceremony was","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20145",22661,"proceeding, and I shortly found myself transported far from that world","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20146",22661,"of which my newly born desires were furiously besieging the entrance.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"

"20150",22661,"will. Thus it is, perhaps, that so many young girls walk to the altar","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20151",22661,"firmly resolved to refuse in a startling manner the husband imposed","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20152",22661,"upon them, and that yet not one ever fulfils her intention. Thus it is,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20153",22661,"doubtless, that so many poor novices take the veil, though they have","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20154",22661,"resolved to tear it into shreds at the moment when called upon to utter","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20155",22661,"the vows. One dares not thus cause so great a scandal to all present,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20156",22661,"nor deceive the expectation of so many people. All those eyes, all those","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20157",22661,"wills seem to weigh down upon you like a cope of lead, and, moreover,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20158",22661,"measures have been so well taken, everything has been so thoroughly","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20159",22661,"arranged beforehand and after a fashion so evidently irrevocable, that","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20160",22661,"the will yields to the weight of circumstances and utterly breaks down.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20161",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20162",22661,"As the ceremony proceeded the features of the fair unknown changed their","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20163",22661,"expression. Her look had at first been one of caressing tenderness;","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20164",22661,"it changed to an air of disdain and of mortification, as though at not","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20165",22661,"having been able to make itself understood.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20166",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20167",22661,"With an effort of will sufficient to have uprooted a mountain, I strove","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20168",22661,"to cry out that I would not be a priest, but I could not speak; my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20169",22661,"tongue seemed nailed to my palate, and I found it impossible to express","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20170",22661,"my will by the least syllable of negation. Though fully awake, I felt","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20171",22661,"like one under the influence of a nightmare, who vainly strives to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20172",22661,"shriek out the one word upon which life depends.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20173",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20174",22661,"She seemed conscious of the martyrdom I was undergoing, and, as though","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20175",22661,"to encourage me, she gave me a look replete with divinest promise. Her","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20176",22661,"eyes were a poem; their every glance was a song.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20177",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"

"20180",22661,"'If thou wilt be mine, I shall make thee happier than God Himself in His","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20181",22661,"paradise. The angels themselves will be jealous of thee. Tear off that","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20182",22661,"funeral shroud in which thou art about to wrap thyself. I am Beauty, I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20183",22661,"am Youth, I am Life. Come to me! Together we shall be Love. Can Jehovah","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20184",22661,"offer thee aught in exchange? Our lives will flow on like a dream, in","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20185",22661,"one eternal kiss.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"

"20188",22661,"thee to the Unknown Isles. Thou shalt sleep in my bosom upon a bed of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20189",22661,"massy gold under a silver pavilion, for I love thee and would take thee","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20190",22661,"away from thy God, before whom so many noble hearts pour forth floods of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"

"20192",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20193",22661,"These words seemed to float to my ears in a rhythm of infinite","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20194",22661,"sweetness, for her look was actually sonorous, and the utterances of her","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20195",22661,"eyes were reechoed in the depths of my heart as though living lips had","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20196",22661,"breathed them into my life. I felt myself willing to renounce God,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20197",22661,"and yet my tongue mechanically fulfilled all the formalities of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20198",22661,"the ceremony. The fair one gave me another look, so beseeching, so","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20199",22661,"despairing that keen blades seemed to pierce my heart, and I felt my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20200",22661,"bosom transfixed by more swords than those of Our Lady of Sorrows.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20201",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"

"20205",22661,"maiden who beholds her affianced lover suddenly fall dead at her side,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20206",22661,"the mother bending over the empty cradle of her child, Eve seated at","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20207",22661,"the threshold of the gate of Paradise, the miser who finds a stone","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20208",22661,"substituted for his stolen treasure, the poet who accidentally permits","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20209",22661,"the only manuscript of his finest work to fall into the fire, could not","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20210",22661,"wear a look so despairing, so inconsolable. All the blood had abandoned","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20211",22661,"her charming face, leaving it whiter than marble; her beautiful arms","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20212",22661,"hung lifelessly on either side of her body as though their muscles","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20213",22661,"had suddenly relaxed, and she sought the support of a pillar, for her","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20214",22661,"yielding limbs almost betrayed her. As for myself, I staggered toward","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20215",22661,"the door of the church, livid as death, my forehead bathed with a sweat","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20216",22661,"bloodier than that of Calvary; I felt as though I were being strangled;","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20217",22661,"the vault seemed to have flattened down upon my shoulders, and it seemed","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20218",22661,"to me that my head alone sustained the whole weight of the dome.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20219",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20220",22661,"As I was about to cross the threshold a hand suddenly caught mine--a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20221",22661,"woman's hand! I had never till then touched the hand of any woman.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20222",22661,"It was cold as a serpent's skin, and yet its impress remained upon my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20223",22661,"wrist, burnt there as though branded by a glowing iron. It was she.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20224",22661,"'Unhappy man! Unhappy man! What hast thou done?' she exclaimed in a low","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20225",22661,"voice, and immediately disappeared in the crowd.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20226",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20227",22661,"The aged bishop passed by. He cast a severe and scrutinising look upon","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20228",22661,"me. My face presented the wildest aspect imaginable: I blushed and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20229",22661,"turned pale alternately; dazzling lights flashed before my eyes. A","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20230",22661,"companion took pity on me. He seized my arm and led me out. I could","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20231",22661,"not possibly have found my way back to the seminary unassisted. At the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20232",22661,"corner of a street, while the young priest's attention was momentarily","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20233",22661,"turned in another direction, a negro page, fantastically garbed,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20234",22661,"approached me, and without pausing on his way slipped into my hand","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20235",22661,"a little pocket-book with gold-embroidered corners, at the same time","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20236",22661,"giving me a sign to hide it. I concealed it in my sleeve, and there kept","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20237",22661,"it until I found myself alone in my cell. Then I opened the clasp. There","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20238",22661,"were only two leaves within, bearing the words, 'Clarimonde. At the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20239",22661,"Concini Palace.' So little acquainted was I at that time with the things","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20240",22661,"of this world that I had never heard of Clarimonde, celebrated as she","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20241",22661,"was, and I had no idea as to where the Concini Palace was situated. I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20242",22661,"hazarded a thousand conjectures, each more extravagant than the last;","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20243",22661,"but, in truth, I cared little whether she were a great lady or a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20244",22661,"courtesan, so that I could but see her once more.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20245",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20246",22661,"My love, although the growth of a single hour, had taken imperishable","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20247",22661,"root. I did not even dream of attempting to tear it up, so fully was I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20248",22661,"convinced such a thing would be impossible. That woman had completely","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20249",22661,"taken possession of me. One look from her had sufficed to change my very","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20250",22661,"nature. She had breathed her will into my life, and I no longer lived","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20251",22661,"in myself, but in her and for her. I gave myself up to a thousand","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20252",22661,"extravagancies. I kissed the place upon my hand which she had touched,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20253",22661,"and I repeated her name over and over again for hours in succession. I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20254",22661,"only needed to close my eyes in order to see her distinctly as though","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20255",22661,"she were actually present; and I reiterated to myself the words she had","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20256",22661,"uttered in my ear at the church porch: 'Unhappy man! Unhappy man! What","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20257",22661,"hast thou done?' I comprehended at last the full horror of my situation,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20258",22661,"and the funereal and awful restraints of the state into which I had just","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20259",22661,"entered became clearly revealed to me. To be a priest!--that is, to be","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20260",22661,"chaste, to never love, to observe no distinction of sex or age, to turn","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20261",22661,"from the sight of all beauty, to put out one's own eyes, to hide for","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20262",22661,"ever crouching in the chill shadows of some church or cloister, to visit","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20263",22661,"none but the dying, to watch by unknown corpses, and ever bear about","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20264",22661,"with one the black soutane as a garb of mourning for oneself, so that","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20265",22661,"your very dress might serve as a pall for your coffin.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20266",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20267",22661,"And I felt life rising within me like a subterranean lake, expanding","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20268",22661,"and overflowing; my blood leaped fiercely through my arteries; my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20269",22661,"long-restrained youth suddenly burst into active being, like the aloe","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20270",22661,"which blooms but once in a hundred years, and then bursts into blossom","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20271",22661,"with a clap of thunder.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20272",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20273",22661,"What could I do in order to see Clarimonde once more? I had no pretext","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20274",22661,"to offer for desiring to leave the seminary, not knowing any person in","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20275",22661,"the city. I would not even be able to remain there but a short time,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20276",22661,"and was only waiting my assignment to the curacy which I must thereafter","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20277",22661,"occupy. I tried to remove the bars of the window; but it was at a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20278",22661,"fearful height from the ground, and I found that as I had no ladder it","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20279",22661,"would be useless to think of escaping thus. And, furthermore, I could","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20280",22661,"descend thence only by night in any event, and afterward how should I be","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20281",22661,"able to find my way through the inextricable labyrinth of streets?","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20282",22661,"All these difficulties, which to many would have appeared altogether","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20283",22661,"insignificant, were gigantic to me, a poor seminarist who had fallen in","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20284",22661,"love only the day before for the first time, without experience, without","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20285",22661,"money, without attire.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20286",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20287",22661,"'Ah!' cried I to myself in my blindness, 'were I not a priest I could","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20288",22661,"have seen her every day; I might have been her lover, her spouse.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20289",22661,"Instead of being wrapped in this dismal shroud of mine I would have had","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20290",22661,"garments of silk and velvet, golden chains, a sword, and fair plumes","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20291",22661,"like other handsome young cavaliers. My hair, instead of being","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20292",22661,"dishonoured by the tonsure, would flow down upon my neck in waving","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20293",22661,"curls; I would have a fine waxed moustache; I would be a gallant.' But","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20294",22661,"one hour passed before an altar, a few hastily articulated words, had","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20295",22661,"for ever cut me off from the number of the living, and I had myself","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20296",22661,"sealed down the stone of my own tomb; I had with my own hand bolted the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20297",22661,"gate of my prison! I went to the window. The sky was beautifully blue;","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20298",22661,"the trees had donned their spring robes; nature seemed to be making","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20299",22661,"parade of an ironical joy. The _Place_ was filled with people, some","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20300",22661,"going, others coming; young beaux and young beauties were sauntering in","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20301",22661,"couples toward the groves and gardens; merry youths passed by, cheerily","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20302",22661,"trolling refrains of drinking-songs--it was all a picture of vivacity,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20303",22661,"life, animation, gaiety, which formed a bitter contrast with my mourning","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20304",22661,"and my solitude. On the steps of the gate sat a young mother playing","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20305",22661,"with her child. She kissed its little rosy mouth still impearled with","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20306",22661,"drops of milk, and performed, in order to amuse it, a thousand divine","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20307",22661,"little puerilities such as only mothers know how to invent. The father","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20308",22661,"standing at a little distance smiled gently upon the charming group, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20309",22661,"with folded arms seemed to hug his joy to his heart. I could not endure","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20310",22661,"that spectacle. I closed the window with violence, and flung myself on","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20311",22661,"my bed, my heart filled with frightful hate and jealousy, and gnawed my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20312",22661,"fingers and my bedcovers like a tiger that has passed ten days without","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20313",22661,"food.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"

"20315",22661,"I know not how long I remained in this condition, but at last, while","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20316",22661,"writhing on the bed in a fit of spasmodic fury, I suddenly perceived","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20317",22661,"the Abbe Serapion, who was standing erect in the centre of the room,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20318",22661,"watching me attentively. Filled with shame of myself, I let my head fall","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20319",22661,"upon my breast and covered my face with my hands.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20320",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20321",22661,"'Romuald, my friend, something very extraordinary is transpiring within","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20322",22661,"you,' observed Serapion, after a few moments' silence; 'your conduct is","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20323",22661,"altogether inexplicable. You--always so quiet, so pious, so gentle--you","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20324",22661,"to rage in your cell like a wild beast! Take heed, brother--do not","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20325",22661,"listen to the suggestions of the devil The Evil Spirit, furious that you","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20326",22661,"have consecrated yourself for ever to the Lord, is prowling around you","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20327",22661,"like a ravening wolf and making a last effort to obtain possession of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20328",22661,"you. Instead of allowing yourself to be conquered, my dear Romuald,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20329",22661,"make to yourself a cuirass of prayers, a buckler of mortifications, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20330",22661,"combat the enemy like a valiant man; you will then assuredly overcome","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20331",22661,"him. Virtue must be proved by temptation, and gold comes forth purer","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20332",22661,"from the hands of the assayer. Fear not. Never allow yourself to become","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20333",22661,"discouraged. The most watchful and steadfast souls are at moments liable","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20334",22661,"to such temptation. Pray, fast, meditate, and the Evil Spirit will","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20335",22661,"depart from you.'","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20336",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20337",22661,"The words of the Abbe Serapion restored me to myself, and I became a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20338",22661,"little more calm. 'I came,' he continued, 'to tell you that you have","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20339",22661,"been appointed to the curacy of C------. The priest who had charge of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20340",22661,"it has just died, and Monseigneur the Bishop has ordered me to have you","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20341",22661,"installed there at once. Be ready, therefore, to start to-morrow.'","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20342",22661,"I responded with an inclination of the head, and the Abbe retired. I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20343",22661,"opened my missal and commenced reading some prayers, but the letters","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20344",22661,"became confused and blurred under my eyes, the thread of the ideas","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20345",22661,"entangled itself hopelessly in my brain, and the volume at last fell","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20346",22661,"from my hands without my being aware of it.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"

"20356",22661,"Then suddenly recurred to me the words of the Abbe Serapion regarding","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20357",22661,"the artifices of the devil; and the strange character of the adventure,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20358",22661,"the supernatural beauty of Clarimonde, the phosphoric light of her eyes,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20359",22661,"the burning imprint of her hand, the agony into which she had thrown","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20360",22661,"me, the sudden change wrought within me when all my piety vanished in a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20361",22661,"single instant--these and other things clearly testified to the work","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20362",22661,"of the Evil One, and perhaps that satiny hand was but the glove which","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20363",22661,"concealed his claws. Filled with terror at these fancies, I again picked","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20364",22661,"up the missal which had slipped from my knees and fallen upon the floor,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20365",22661,"and once more gave myself up to prayer.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20366",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20367",22661,"Next morning Serapion came to take me away. Two mules freighted with","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20368",22661,"our miserable valises awaited us at the gate. He mounted one, and I the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20369",22661,"other as well as I knew how.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20370",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20371",22661,"As we passed along the streets of the city, I gazed attentively at all","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20372",22661,"the windows and balconies in the hope of seeing Clarimonde, but it was","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20373",22661,"yet early in the morning, and the city had hardly opened its eyes. Mine","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20374",22661,"sought to penetrate the blinds and window-curtains of all the palaces","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20375",22661,"before which we were passing. Serapion doubtless attributed this","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20376",22661,"curiosity to my admiration of the architecture, for he slackened the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20377",22661,"pace of his animal in order to give me time to look around me. At last","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20378",22661,"we passed the city gates and commenced to mount the hill beyond. When","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20379",22661,"we arrived at its summit I turned to take a last look at the place where","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20380",22661,"Clarimonde dwelt. The shadow of a great cloud hung over all the city;","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20381",22661,"the contrasting colours of its blue and red roofs were lost in the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20382",22661,"uniform half-tint, through which here and there floated upward, like","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20383",22661,"white flakes of foam, the smoke of freshly kindled fires. By a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20384",22661,"singular optical effect one edifice, which surpassed in height all the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20385",22661,"neighbouring buildings that were still dimly veiled by the vapours,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20386",22661,"towered up, fair and lustrous with the gilding of a solitary beam of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20387",22661,"sunlight--although actually more than a league away it seemed","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20388",22661,"quite near. The smallest details of its architecture were plainly","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20389",22661,"distinguishable--the turrets, the platforms, the window-casements, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20390",22661,"even the swallow-tailed weather-vanes.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20391",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20392",22661,"'What is that palace I see over there, all lighted up by the sun?' I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20393",22661,"asked Serapion. He shaded his eyes with his hand, and having looked in","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20394",22661,"the direction indicated, replied: 'It is the ancient palace which the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20395",22661,"Prince Concini has given to the courtesan Clarimonde. Awful things are","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20396",22661,"done there!'","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20397",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20398",22661,"At that instant, I know not yet whether it was a reality or an illusion,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20399",22661,"I fancied I saw gliding along the terrace a shapely white figure,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20400",22661,"which gleamed for a moment in passing and as quickly vanished. It was","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20401",22661,"Clarimonde.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20402",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20403",22661,"Oh, did she know that at that very hour, all feverish and restless--from","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20404",22661,"the height of the rugged road which separated me from her, and which,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20405",22661,"alas! I could never more descend--I was directing my eyes upon the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20406",22661,"palace where she dwelt, and which a mocking beam of sunlight seemed to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20407",22661,"bring nigh to me, as though inviting me to enter therein as its lord?","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20408",22661,"Undoubtedly she must have known it, for her soul was too sympathetically","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20409",22661,"united with mine not to have felt its least emotional thrill, and that","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20410",22661,"subtle sympathy it must have been which prompted her to climb--although","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20411",22661,"clad only in her nightdress--to the summit of the terrace, amid the icy","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20412",22661,"dews of the morning.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20413",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20414",22661,"The shadow gained the palace, and the scene became to the eye only","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20415",22661,"a motionless ocean of roofs and gables, amid which one mountainous","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20416",22661,"undulation was distinctly visible. Serapion urged his mule forward, my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20417",22661,"own at once followed at the same gait, and a sharp angle in the road at","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20418",22661,"last hid the city of S------ for ever from my eyes, as I was destined","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20419",22661,"never to return thither. At the close of a weary three-days' journey","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20420",22661,"through dismal country fields, we caught sight of the cock upon the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20421",22661,"steeple of the church which I was to take charge of, peeping above","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20422",22661,"the trees, and after having followed some winding roads fringed with","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20423",22661,"thatched cottages and little gardens, we found ourselves in front of the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20424",22661,"facade, which certainly possessed few features of magnificence. A porch","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20425",22661,"ornamented with some mouldings, and two or three pillars rudely hewn","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20426",22661,"from sandstone; a tiled roof with counterforts of the same sandstone as","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20427",22661,"the pillars--that was all. To the left lay the cemetery, overgrown with","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20428",22661,"high weeds, and having a great iron cross rising up in its centre; to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20429",22661,"the right stood the presbytery under the shadow of the church. It was a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20430",22661,"house of the most extreme simplicity and frigid cleanliness. We entered","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20431",22661,"the enclosure. A few chickens were picking up some oats scattered upon","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20432",22661,"the ground; accustomed, seemingly, to the black habit of ecclesiastics,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20433",22661,"they showed no fear of our presence and scarcely troubled themselves to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20434",22661,"get out of our way. A hoarse, wheezy barking fell upon our ears, and we","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20435",22661,"saw an aged dog running toward us.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20436",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20437",22661,"It was my predecessor's dog. He had dull bleared eyes, grizzled hair,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20438",22661,"and every mark of the greatest age to which a dog can possibly attain.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20439",22661,"I patted him gently, and he proceeded at once to march along beside me","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20440",22661,"with an air of satisfaction unspeakable. A very old woman, who had been","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20441",22661,"the housekeeper of the former cure, also came to meet us, and after","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20442",22661,"having invited me into a little back parlour, asked whether I intended","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20443",22661,"to retain her. I replied that I would take care of her, and the dog, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20444",22661,"the chickens, and all the furniture her master had bequeathed her at","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20445",22661,"his death. At this she became fairly transported with joy, and the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20446",22661,"Abbe Serapion at once paid her the price which she asked for her little","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20447",22661,"property.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20448",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20449",22661,"As soon as my installation was over, the Abbe Serapion returned to the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20450",22661,"seminary. I was, therefore, left alone, with no one but myself to look","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20451",22661,"to for aid or counsel. The thought of Clarimonde again began to haunt","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20452",22661,"me, and in spite of all my endeavours to banish it, I always found it","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20453",22661,"present in my meditations. One evening, while promenading in my little","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20454",22661,"garden along the walks bordered with box-plants, I fancied that I saw","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20455",22661,"through the elm-trees the figure of a woman, who followed my every","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20456",22661,"movement, and that I beheld two sea-green eyes gleaming through the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20457",22661,"foliage; but it was only an illusion, and on going round to the other","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20458",22661,"side of the garden, I could find nothing except a footprint on the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20459",22661,"sanded walk--a footprint so small that it seemed to have been made","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20460",22661,"by the foot of a child. The garden was enclosed by very high walls. I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20461",22661,"searched every nook and corner of it, but could discover no one there.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20462",22661,"I have never succeeded in fully accounting for this circumstance, which,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20463",22661,"after all, was nothing compared with the strange things which happened","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20464",22661,"to me afterward.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20465",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20466",22661,"For a whole year I lived thus, filling all the duties of my calling","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20467",22661,"with the most scrupulous exactitude, praying and fasting, exhorting and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20468",22661,"lending ghostly aid to the sick, and bestowing alms even to the extent","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20469",22661,"of frequently depriving myself of the very necessaries of life. But I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20470",22661,"felt a great aridness within me, and the sources of grace seemed closed","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20471",22661,"against me. I never found that happiness which should spring from the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20472",22661,"fulfilment of a holy mission; my thoughts were far away, and the words","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20473",22661,"of Clarimonde were ever upon my lips like an involuntary refrain. Oh,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20474",22661,"brother, meditate well on this! Through having but once lifted my eyes","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20475",22661,"to look upon a woman, through one fault apparently so venial, I have for","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20476",22661,"years remained a victim to the most miserable agonies, and the happiness","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20477",22661,"of my life has been destroyed for ever.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20478",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20479",22661,"I will not longer dwell upon those defeats, or on those inward victories","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20480",22661,"invariably followed by yet more terrible falls, but will at once proceed","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20481",22661,"to the facts of my story. One night my door-bell was long and violently","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20482",22661,"rung. The aged housekeeper arose and opened to the stranger, and the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20483",22661,"figure of a man, whose complexion was deeply bronzed, and who was richly","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20484",22661,"clad in a foreign costume, with a poniard at his girdle, appeared under","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20485",22661,"the rays of Barbara's lantern. Her first impulse was one of terror, but","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20486",22661,"the stranger reassured her, and stated that he desired to see me at once","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20487",22661,"on matters relating to my holy calling. Barbara invited him upstairs,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20488",22661,"where I was on the point of retiring. The stranger told me that his","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20489",22661,"mistress, a very noble lady, was lying at the point of death, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20490",22661,"desired to see a priest. I replied that I was prepared to follow him,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20491",22661,"took with me the sacred articles necessary for extreme unction, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20492",22661,"descended in all haste. Two horses black as the night itself stood","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20493",22661,"without the gate, pawing the ground with impatience, and veiling their","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20494",22661,"chests with long streams of smoky vapour exhaled from their nostrils. He","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20495",22661,"held the stirrup and aided me to mount upon one; then, merely laying his","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20496",22661,"hand upon the pommel of the saddle, he vaulted on the other, pressed","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20497",22661,"the animal's sides with his knees, and loosened rein. The horse bounded","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20498",22661,"forward with the velocity of an arrow. Mine, of which the stranger held","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20499",22661,"the bridle, also started off at a swift gallop, keeping up with his","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20500",22661,"companion. We devoured the road. The ground flowed backward beneath us","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20501",22661,"in a long streaked line of pale gray, and the black silhouettes of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20502",22661,"the trees seemed fleeing by us on either side like an army in rout. We","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20503",22661,"passed through a forest so profoundly gloomy that I felt my flesh creep","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20504",22661,"in the chill darkness with superstitious fear. The showers of bright","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20505",22661,"sparks which flew from the stony road under the ironshod feet of our","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20506",22661,"horses remained glowing in our wake like a fiery trail; and had any one","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20507",22661,"at that hour of the night beheld us both--my guide and myself--he must","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20508",22661,"have taken us for two spectres riding upon nightmares. Witch-fires ever","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20509",22661,"and anon flitted across the road before us, and the night-birds","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20510",22661,"shrieked fearsomely in the depth of the woods beyond, where we beheld","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20511",22661,"at intervals glow the phosphorescent eyes of wild cats. The manes of the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20512",22661,"horses became more and more dishevelled, the sweat streamed over their","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20513",22661,"flanks, and their breath came through their nostrils hard and fast. But","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20514",22661,"when he found them slacking pace, the guide reanimated them by uttering","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20515",22661,"a strange, gutteral, unearthly cry, and the gallop recommenced with","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20516",22661,"fury. At last the whirlwind race ceased; a huge black mass pierced","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20517",22661,"through with many bright points of light suddenly rose before us, the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20518",22661,"hoofs of our horses echoed louder upon a strong wooden drawbridge, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20519",22661,"we rode under a great vaulted archway which darkly yawned between two","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20520",22661,"enormous towers. Some great excitement evidently reigned in the castle.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20521",22661,"Servants with torches were crossing the courtyard in every direction,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20522",22661,"and above lights were ascending and descending from landing to landing.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20523",22661,"I obtained a confused glimpse of vast masses of architecture--columns,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20524",22661,"arcades, flights of steps, stairways--a royal voluptuousness and elfin","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20525",22661,"magnificence of construction worthy of fairyland. A negro page--the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20526",22661,"same who had before brought me the tablet from Clarimonde, and whom","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20527",22661,"I instantly recognised--approached to aid me in dismounting, and the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20528",22661,"major-domo, attired in black velvet with a gold chain about his neck,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20529",22661,"advanced to meet me, supporting himself upon an ivory cane. Large tears","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20530",22661,"were falling from his eyes and streaming over his cheeks and white","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20531",22661,"beard. 'Too late!' he cried, sorrowfully shaking his venerable head.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20532",22661,"'Too late, sir priest! But if you have not been able to save the soul,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20533",22661,"come at least to watch by the poor body.'","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20534",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20535",22661,"He took my arm and conducted me to the death-chamber. I wept not less","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20536",22661,"bitterly than he, for I had learned that the dead one was none other","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20537",22661,"than that Clarimonde whom I had so deeply and so wildly loved. A","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20538",22661,"_prie-dieu_ stood at the foot of the bed; a bluish flame flickering in a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20539",22661,"bronze patern filled all the room with a wan, deceptive light, here","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20540",22661,"and there bringing out in the darkness at intervals some projection","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20541",22661,"of furniture or cornice. In a chiselled urn upon the table there was a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20542",22661,"faded white rose, whose leaves--excepting one that still held--had all","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20543",22661,"fallen, like odorous tears, to the foot of the vase. A broken black","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20544",22661,"mask, a fan, and disguises of every variety, which were lying on the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20545",22661,"armchairs, bore witness that death had entered suddenly and unannounced","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20546",22661,"into that sumptuous dwelling. Without daring to cast my eyes upon the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20547",22661,"bed, I knelt down and commenced to repeat the Psalms for the Dead, with","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20548",22661,"exceeding fervour, thanking God that He had placed the tomb between","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20549",22661,"me and the memory of this woman, so that I might thereafter be able to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20550",22661,"utter her name in my prayers as a name for ever sanctified by death.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20551",22661,"But my fervour gradually weakened, and I fell insensibly into a reverie.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20552",22661,"That chamber bore no semblance to a chamber of death. In lieu of the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20553",22661,"fetid and cadaverous odours which I had been accustomed to breathe","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20554",22661,"during such funereal vigils, a languorous vapour of Oriental perfume--I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20555",22661,"know not what amorous odour of woman--softly floated through the tepid","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20556",22661,"air. That pale light seemed rather a twilight gloom contrived for","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20557",22661,"voluptuous pleasure, than a substitute for the yellow-flickering","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20558",22661,"watch-tapers which shine by the side of corpses. I thought upon the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20559",22661,"strange destiny which enabled me to meet Clarimonde again at the very","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20560",22661,"moment when she was lost to me for ever, and a sigh of regretful anguish","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20561",22661,"escaped from my breast. Then it seemed to me that some one behind me","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20562",22661,"had also sighed, and I turned round to look. It was only an echo. But in","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20563",22661,"that moment my eyes fell upon the bed of death which they had till then","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20564",22661,"avoided. The red damask curtains, decorated with large flowers worked in","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20565",22661,"embroidery and looped up with gold bullion, permitted me to behold the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20566",22661,"fair dead, lying at full length, with hands joined upon her bosom. She","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20567",22661,"was covered with a linen wrapping of dazzling whiteness, which formed","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20568",22661,"a strong contrast with the gloomy purple of the hangings, and was of so","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20569",22661,"fine a texture that it concealed nothing of her body's charming form,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20570",22661,"and allowed the eye to follow those beautiful outlines--undulating like","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20571",22661,"the neck of a swan--which even death had not robbed of their supple","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20572",22661,"grace. She seemed an alabaster statue executed by some skilful sculptor","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20573",22661,"to place upon the tomb of a queen, or rather, perhaps, like a slumbering","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20574",22661,"maiden over whom the silent snow had woven a spotless veil.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20575",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20576",22661,"I could no longer maintain my constrained attitude of prayer. The air","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20577",22661,"of the alcove intoxicated me, that febrile perfume of half-faded roses","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20578",22661,"penetrated my very brain, and I commenced to pace restlessly up and down","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20579",22661,"the chamber, pausing at each turn before the bier to contemplate the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20580",22661,"graceful corpse lying beneath the transparency of its shroud. Wild","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20581",22661,"fancies came thronging to my brain. I thought to myself that she might","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20582",22661,"not, perhaps, be really dead; that she might only have feigned death for","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20583",22661,"the purpose of bringing me to her castle, and then declaring her love.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20584",22661,"At one time I even thought I saw her foot move under the whiteness of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20585",22661,"the coverings, and slightly disarrange the long straight folds of the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20586",22661,"winding-sheet.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20587",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20588",22661,"And then I asked myself: 'Is this indeed Clarimonde? What proof have I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20589",22661,"that it is she? Might not that black page have passed into the service","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20590",22661,"of some other lady? Surely, I must be going mad to torture and afflict","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20591",22661,"myself thus!' But my heart answered with a fierce throbbing: 'It is she;","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20592",22661,"it is she indeed!' I approached the bed again, and fixed my eyes with","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20593",22661,"redoubled attention upon the object of my incertitude. Ah, must I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20594",22661,"confess it? That exquisite perfection of bodily form, although purified","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20595",22661,"and made sacred by the shadow of death, affected me more voluptuously","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20596",22661,"than it should have done; and that repose so closely resembled slumber","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20597",22661,"that one might well have mistaken it for such. I forgot that I had come","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20598",22661,"there to perform a funeral ceremony; I fancied myself a young bridegroom","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20599",22661,"entering the chamber of the bride, who all modestly hides her fair face,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20600",22661,"and through coyness seeks to keep herself wholly veiled. Heartbroken","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20601",22661,"with grief, yet wild with hope, shuddering at once with fear and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20602",22661,"pleasure, I bent over her and grasped the corner of the sheet. I lifted","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20603",22661,"it back, holding my breath all the while through fear of waking her. My","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20604",22661,"arteries throbbed with such violence that I felt them hiss through my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20605",22661,"temples, and the sweat poured from my forehead in streams, as though I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20606",22661,"had lifted a mighty slab of marble. There, indeed, lay Clarimonde, even","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20607",22661,"as I had seen her at the church on the day of my ordination. She was not","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20608",22661,"less charming than then. With her, death seemed but a last coquetry. The","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20609",22661,"pallor of her cheeks, the less brilliant carnation of her lips, her long","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20610",22661,"eyelashes lowered and relieving their dark fringe against that white","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20611",22661,"skin, lent her an unspeakably seductive aspect of melancholy chastity","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20612",22661,"and mental suffering; her long loose hair, still intertwined with some","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20613",22661,"little blue flowers, made a shining pillow for her head, and veiled the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20614",22661,"nudity of her shoulders with its thick ringlets; her beautiful hands,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20615",22661,"purer, more diaphanous, than the Host, were crossed on her bosom in an","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20616",22661,"attitude of pious rest and silent prayer, which served to counteract all","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20617",22661,"that might have proven otherwise too alluring--even after death--in the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20618",22661,"exquisite roundness and ivory polish of her bare arms from which the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20619",22661,"pearl bracelets had not yet been removed. I remained long in mute","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20620",22661,"contemplation, and the more I gazed, the less could I persuade myself","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20621",22661,"that life had really abandoned that beautiful body for ever. I do not","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20622",22661,"know whether it was an illusion or a reflection of the lamplight, but it","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20623",22661,"seemed to me that the blood was again commencing to circulate under that","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20624",22661,"lifeless pallor, although she remained all motionless. I laid my hand","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20625",22661,"lightly on her arm; it was cold, but not colder than her hand on the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20626",22661,"day when it touched mine at the portals of the church. I resumed my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20627",22661,"position, bending my face above her, and bathing her cheek with the warm","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20628",22661,"dew of my tears. Ah, what bitter feelings of despair and helplessness,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20629",22661,"what agonies unutterable did I endure in that long watch! Vainly did I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20630",22661,"wish that I could have gathered all my life into one mass that I might","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20631",22661,"give it all to her, and breathe into her chill remains the flame which","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20632",22661,"devoured me. The night advanced, and feeling the moment of eternal","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20633",22661,"separation approach, I could not deny myself the last sad sweet pleasure","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20634",22661,"of imprinting a kiss upon the dead lips of her who had been my only","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20635",22661,"love.... Oh, miracle! A faint breath mingled itself with my breath, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20636",22661,"the mouth of Clarimonde responded to the passionate pressure of mine.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20637",22661,"Her eyes unclosed, and lighted up with something of their former","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20638",22661,"brilliancy; she uttered a long sigh, and uncrossing her arms, passed","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20639",22661,"them around my neck with a look of ineffable delight. 'Ah, it is thou,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20640",22661,"Romuald!' she murmured in a voice languishingly sweet as the last","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20641",22661,"vibrations of a harp. 'What ailed thee, dearest? I waited so long for","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20642",22661,"thee that I am dead; but we are now betrothed: I can see thee and visit","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20643",22661,"thee. Adieu, Romuald, adieu! I love thee. That is all I wished to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20644",22661,"tell thee, and I give thee back the life which thy kiss for a moment","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20645",22661,"recalled. We shall soon meet again.'","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20646",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20647",22661,"Her head fell back, but her arms yet encircled me, as though to retain","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20648",22661,"me still. A furious whirlwind suddenly burst in the window, and entered","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20649",22661,"the chamber. The last remaining leaf of the white rose for a moment","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20650",22661,"palpitated at the extremity of the stalk like a butterfly's wing, then","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20651",22661,"it detached itself and flew forth through the open casement, bearing","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20652",22661,"with it the soul of Clarimonde. The lamp was extinguished, and I fell","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20653",22661,"insensible upon the bosom of the beautiful dead.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20654",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20655",22661,"When I came to myself again I was lying on the bed in my little room at","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20656",22661,"the presbytery, and the old dog of the former cure was licking my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20657",22661,"hand, which had been hanging down outside of the covers. Barbara, all","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20658",22661,"trembling with age and anxiety, was busying herself about the room,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20659",22661,"opening and shutting drawers, and emptying powders into glasses. On","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20660",22661,"seeing me open my eyes, the old woman uttered a cry of joy, the dog","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20661",22661,"yelped and wagged his tail, but I was still so weak that I could not","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20662",22661,"speak a single word or make the slightest motion. Afterward I learned","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20663",22661,"that I had lain thus for three days, giving no evidence of life beyond","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20664",22661,"the faintest respiration. Those three days do not reckon in my life, nor","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20665",22661,"could I ever imagine whither my spirit had departed during those three","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20666",22661,"days; I have no recollection of aught relating to them. Barbara told me","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20667",22661,"that the same coppery-complexioned man who came to seek me on the night","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20668",22661,"of my departure from the presbytery had brought me back the next morning","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20669",22661,"in a close litter, and departed immediately afterward. When I became","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20670",22661,"able to collect my scattered thoughts, I reviewed within my mind all the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20671",22661,"circumstances of that fateful night. At first I thought I had been the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20672",22661,"victim of some magical illusion, but ere long the recollection of other","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20673",22661,"circumstances, real and palpable in themselves, came to forbid that","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20674",22661,"supposition. I could not believe that I had been dreaming, since Barbara","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20675",22661,"as well as myself had seen the strange man with his two black horses,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20676",22661,"and described with exactness every detail of his figure and apparel.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20677",22661,"Nevertheless it appeared that none knew of any castle in the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20678",22661,"neighbourhood answering to the description of that in which I had again","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20679",22661,"found Clarimonde.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20680",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20681",22661,"One morning I found the Abbe Serapion in my room. Barbara had advised","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20682",22661,"him that I was ill, and he had come with all speed to see me. Although","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20683",22661,"this haste on his part testified to an affectionate interest in me, yet","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20684",22661,"his visit did not cause me the pleasure which it should have done. The","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20685",22661,"Abbe Serapion had something penetrating and inquisitorial in his","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20686",22661,"gaze which made me feel very ill at ease. His presence filled me with","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20687",22661,"embarrassment and a sense of guilt. At the first glance he divined my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20688",22661,"interior trouble, and I hated him for his clairvoyance.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20689",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20690",22661,"While he inquired after my health in hypocritically honeyed accents,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20691",22661,"he constantly kept his two great yellow lion-eyes fixed upon me, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20692",22661,"plunged his look into my soul like a sounding-lead. Then he asked me","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20693",22661,"how I directed my parish, if I was happy in it, how I passed the leisure","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20694",22661,"hours allowed me in the intervals of pastoral duty, whether I had","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20695",22661,"become acquainted with many of the inhabitants of the place, what was my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20696",22661,"favourite reading, and a thousand other such questions. I answered these","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20697",22661,"inquiries as briefly as possible, and he, without ever waiting for","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20698",22661,"my answers, passed rapidly from one subject of query to another. That","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20699",22661,"conversation had evidently no connection with what he actually wished to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20700",22661,"say. At last, without any premonition, but as though repeating a piece","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20701",22661,"of news which he had recalled on the instant, and feared might otherwise","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20702",22661,"be forgotten subsequently, he suddenly said, in a clear vibrant voice,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20703",22661,"which rang in my ears like the trumpets of the Last Judgment:","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20704",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20705",22661,"'The great courtesan Clarimonde died a few days ago, at the close of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20706",22661,"an orgie which lasted eight days and eight nights. It was something","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20707",22661,"infernally splendid. The abominations of the banquets of Belshazzar and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20708",22661,"Cleopatra were re-enacted there. Good God, what age are we living in?","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20709",22661,"The guests were served by swarthy slaves who spoke an unknown tongue,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20710",22661,"and who seemed to me to be veritable demons. The livery of the very","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20711",22661,"least among them would have served for the gala-dress of an emperor.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20712",22661,"There have always been very strange stories told of this Clarimonde, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20713",22661,"all her lovers came to a violent or miserable end. They used to say that","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20714",22661,"she was a ghoul, a female vampire; but I believe she was none other than","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20715",22661,"Beelzebub himself.'","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20716",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20717",22661,"He ceased to speak, and commenced to regard me more attentively than","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20718",22661,"ever, as though to observe the effect of his words on me. I could not","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20719",22661,"refrain from starting when I heard him utter the name of Clarimonde, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20720",22661,"this news of her death, in addition to the pain it caused me by reason","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20721",22661,"of its coincidence with the nocturnal scenes I had witnessed, filled","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20722",22661,"me with an agony and terror which my face betrayed, despite my utmost","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20723",22661,"endeavours to appear composed. Serapion fixed an anxious and severe","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20724",22661,"look upon me, and then observed: 'My son, I must warn you that you are","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20725",22661,"standing with foot raised upon the brink of an abyss; take heed lest you","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20726",22661,"fall therein. Satan's claws are long, and tombs are not always true to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20727",22661,"their trust. The tombstone of Clarimonde should be sealed down with a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20728",22661,"triple seal, for, if report be true, it is not the first time she has","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20729",22661,"died. May God watch over you, Romuald!'","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20730",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20731",22661,"And with these words the Abbe walked slowly to the door. I did not see","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20732",22661,"him again at that time, for he left for S------ almost immediately.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20733",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20734",22661,"I became completely restored to health and resumed my accustomed duties.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20735",22661,"The memory of Clarimonde and the words of the old Abbe were constantly","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20736",22661,"in my mind; nevertheless no extraordinary event had occurred to verify","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20737",22661,"the funereal predictions of Serapion, and I had commenced to believe","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20738",22661,"that his fears and my own terrors were over-exaggerated, when one","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20739",22661,"night I had a strange dream. I had hardly fallen asleep when I heard my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20740",22661,"bed-curtains drawn apart, as their rings slided back upon the curtain","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20741",22661,"rod with a sharp sound. I rose up quickly upon my elbow, and beheld","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20742",22661,"the shadow of a woman standing erect before me. I recognised Clarimonde","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20743",22661,"immediately. She bore in her hand a little lamp, shaped like those which","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20744",22661,"are placed in tombs, and its light lent her fingers a rosy transparency,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20745",22661,"which extended itself by lessening degrees even to the opaque and milky","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20746",22661,"whiteness of her bare arm. Her only garment was the linen winding-sheet","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20747",22661,"which had shrouded her when lying upon the bed of death. She sought to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20748",22661,"gather its folds over her bosom as though ashamed of being so scantily","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20749",22661,"clad, but her little hand was not equal to the task. She was so white","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20750",22661,"that the colour of the drapery blended with that of her flesh under","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20751",22661,"the pallid rays of the lamp. Enveloped with this subtle tissue which","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20752",22661,"betrayed all the contour of her body, she seemed rather the marble","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20753",22661,"statue of some fair antique bather than a woman endowed with life. But","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20754",22661,"dead or living, statue or woman, shadow or body, her beauty was still","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20755",22661,"the same, only that the green light of her eyes was less brilliant, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20756",22661,"her mouth, once so warmly crimson, was only tinted with a faint tender","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20757",22661,"rosiness, like that of her cheeks. The little blue flowers which I had","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20758",22661,"noticed entwined in her hair were withered and dry, and had lost nearly","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20759",22661,"all their leaves, but this did not prevent her from being charming--so","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20760",22661,"charming that, notwithstanding the strange character of the adventure,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20761",22661,"and the unexplainable manner in which she had entered my room, I felt","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20762",22661,"not even for a moment the least fear.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20763",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20764",22661,"She placed the lamp on the table and seated herself at the foot of my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20765",22661,"bed; then bending toward me, she said, in that voice at once silvery","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20766",22661,"clear and yet velvety in its sweet softness, such as I never heard from","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20767",22661,"any lips save hers:","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20768",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20769",22661,"'I have kept thee long in waiting, dear Romuald, and it must have seemed","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20770",22661,"to thee that I had forgotten thee. But I come from afar off, very far","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20771",22661,"off, and from a land whence no other has ever yet returned. There is","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20772",22661,"neither sun nor moon in that land whence I come: all is but space and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20773",22661,"shadow; there is neither road nor pathway: no earth for the foot, no air","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20774",22661,"for the wing; and nevertheless behold me here, for Love is stronger than","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20775",22661,"Death and must conquer him in the end. Oh what sad faces and fearful","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20776",22661,"things I have seen on my way hither! What difficulty my soul, returned","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20777",22661,"to earth through the power of will alone, has had in finding its body","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20778",22661,"and reinstating itself therein! What terrible efforts I had to make ere","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20779",22661,"I could lift the ponderous slab with which they had covered me! See, the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20780",22661,"palms of my poor hands are all bruised! Kiss them, sweet love, that they","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20781",22661,"may be healed!' She laid the cold palms of her hands upon ray mouth, one","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20782",22661,"after the other. I kissed them, indeed, many times, and she the while","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20783",22661,"watched me with a smile of ineffable affection.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20784",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20785",22661,"I confess to my shame that I had entirely forgotten the advice of the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20786",22661,"Abbe Serapion and the sacred office wherewith I had been invested. I had","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20787",22661,"fallen without resistance, and at the first assault. I had not even","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20788",22661,"made the least effort to repel the tempter. The fresh coolness of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20789",22661,"Clarimonde's skin penetrated my own, and I felt voluptuous tremors pass","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20790",22661,"over my whole body. Poor child! in spite of all I saw afterward, I can","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20791",22661,"hardly yet believe she was a demon; at least she had no appearance","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20792",22661,"of being such, and never did Satan so skilfully conceal his claws and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20793",22661,"horns. She had drawn her feet up beneath her, and squatted down on the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20794",22661,"edge of the couch in an attitude full of negligent coquetry. From time","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20795",22661,"to time she passed her little hand through my hair and twisted it into","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20796",22661,"curls, as though trying how a new style of wearing it would become my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20797",22661,"face. I abandoned myself to her hands with the most guilty pleasure,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20798",22661,"while she accompanied her gentle play with the prettiest prattle. The","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20799",22661,"most remarkable fact was that I felt no astonishment whatever at so","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20800",22661,"extraordinary ah adventure, and as in dreams one finds no difficulty","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20801",22661,"in accepting the most fantastic events as simple facts, so all these","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20802",22661,"circumstances seemed to me perfectly natural in themselves.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20803",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20804",22661,"'I loved thee long ere I saw thee, dear Romuald, and sought thee","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20805",22661,"everywhere. Thou wast my dream, and I first saw thee in the church at","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20806",22661,"the fatal moment. I said at once, ""It is he!"" I gave thee a look into","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20807",22661,"which I threw all the love I ever had, all the love I now have, all","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20808",22661,"the love I shall ever have for thee--a look that would have damned a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20809",22661,"cardinal or brought a king to his knees at my feet in view of all his","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20810",22661,"court. Thou remainedst unmoved, preferring thy God to me!","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20811",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20812",22661,"'Ah, how jealous I am of that God whom thou didst love and still lovest","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20813",22661,"more than me!","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20814",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20815",22661,"'Woe is me, unhappy one that I am! I can never have thy heart all to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20816",22661,"myself, I whom thou didst recall to life with a kiss--dead Clarimonde,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20817",22661,"who for thy sake bursts asunder the gates of the tomb, and comes to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20818",22661,"consecrate to thee a life which she has resumed only to make thee","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20819",22661,"happy!'","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20820",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20821",22661,"All her words were accompanied with the most impassioned caresses, which","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20822",22661,"bewildered my sense and my reason to such an extent, that I did not fear","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20823",22661,"to utter a frightful blasphemy for the sake of consoling her, and to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20824",22661,"declare that I loved her as much as God.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20825",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20826",22661,"Her eyes rekindled and shone like chrysoprases. 'In truth?--in very","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20827",22661,"truth?--as much as God!' she cried, flinging her beautiful arms around","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20828",22661,"me. 'Since it is so, thou wilt come with me; thou wilt follow me","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20829",22661,"whithersoever I desire. Thou wilt cast away thy ugly black habit. Thou","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20830",22661,"shalt be the proudest and most envied of cavaliers; thou shalt be my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20831",22661,"lover! To be the acknowledged lover of Clarimonde, who has refused","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20832",22661,"even a Pope! That will be something to feel proud of. Ah, the fair,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20833",22661,"unspeakably happy existence, the beautiful golden life we shall live","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20834",22661,"together! And when shall we depart, my fair sir?'","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20835",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20836",22661,"'To-morrow! To-morrow!' I cried in my delirium.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20837",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20838",22661,"'To-morrow, then, so let it be!' she answered. 'In the meanwhile I shall","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20839",22661,"have opportunity to change my toilet, for this is a little too light","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20840",22661,"and in nowise suited for a voyage. I must also forthwith notify all","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20841",22661,"my friends who believe me dead, and mourn for me as deeply as they are","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20842",22661,"capable of doing. The money, the dresses, the carriages--all will be","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20843",22661,"ready. I shall call for thee at this same hour. Adieu, dear heart!' And","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20844",22661,"she lightly touched my forehead with her lips. The lamp went out, the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20845",22661,"curtains closed again, and all became dark; a leaden, dreamless sleep","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20846",22661,"fell on me and held me unconscious until the morning following.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20847",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20848",22661,"I awoke later than usual, and the recollection of this singular","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20849",22661,"adventure troubled me during the whole day. I finally persuaded myself","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20850",22661,"that it was a mere vapour of my heated imagination. Nevertheless its","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20851",22661,"sensations had been so vivid that it was difficult to persuade myself","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20852",22661,"that they were not real, and it was not without some presentiment of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20853",22661,"what was going to happen that I got into bed at last, after having","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20854",22661,"prayed God to drive far from me all thoughts of evil, and to protect the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20855",22661,"chastity of my slumber.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20856",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20857",22661,"I soon fell into a deep sleep, and my dream was continued. The curtains","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20858",22661,"again parted, and I beheld Clarimonde, not as on the former occasion,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20859",22661,"pale in her pale winding-sheet, with the violets of death upon her","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20860",22661,"cheeks, but gay, sprightly, jaunty, in a superb travelling-dress of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20861",22661,"green velvet, trimmed with gold lace, and looped up on either side to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20862",22661,"allow a glimpse of satin petticoat. Her blond hair escaped in thick","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20863",22661,"ringlets from beneath a broad black felt hat, decorated with white","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20864",22661,"feathers whimsically twisted into various shapes. In one hand she held a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20865",22661,"little riding-whip terminated by a golden whistle. She tapped me lightly","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20866",22661,"with it, and exclaimed: 'Well, my fine sleeper, is this the way you","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20867",22661,"make your preparations? I thought I would find you up and dressed. Arise","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20868",22661,"quickly, we have no time to lose.'","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20869",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20870",22661,"I leaped out of bed at once.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20871",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20872",22661,"'Come, dress yourself, and let us go,' she continued, pointing to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20873",22661,"a little package she had brought with her. 'The horses are becoming","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20874",22661,"impatient of delay and champing their bits at the door. We ought to have","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20875",22661,"been by this time at least ten leagues distant from here.'","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20876",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20877",22661,"I dressed myself hurriedly, and she handed me the articles of apparel","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20878",22661,"herself one by one, bursting into laughter from time to time at my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20879",22661,"awkwardness, as she explained to me the use of a garment when I had made","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20880",22661,"a mistake. She hurriedly arranged my hair, and this done, held up","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20881",22661,"before me a little pocket-mirror of Venetian crystal, rimmed with silver","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20882",22661,"filigree-work, and playfully asked: 'How dost find thyself now? Wilt","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20883",22661,"engage me for thy valet de chambre?'","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20884",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20885",22661,"I was no longer the same person, and I could not even recognise myself.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20886",22661,"I resembled my former self no more than a finished statue resembles","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20887",22661,"a block of stone. My old face seemed but a coarse daub of the one","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20888",22661,"reflected in the mirror. I was handsome, and my vanity was sensibly","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20889",22661,"tickled by the metamorphosis.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20890",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20891",22661,"That elegant apparel, that richly embroidered vest had made of me","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20892",22661,"a totally different personage, and I marvelled at the power of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20893",22661,"transformation owned by a few yards of cloth cut after a certain","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20894",22661,"pattern. The spirit of my costume penetrated my very skin and within ten","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20895",22661,"minutes more I had become something of a coxcomb.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20896",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20897",22661,"In order to feel more at ease in my new attire, I took several turns","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20898",22661,"up and down the room. Clari-monde watched me with an air of maternal","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20899",22661,"pleasure, and appeared well satisfied with her work. 'Come, enough of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20900",22661,"this child's play! Let us start, Romuald, dear. We have far to go, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20901",22661,"we may not get there in time.' She took my hand and led me forth. All","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20902",22661,"the doors opened before her at a touch, and we passed by the dog without","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20903",22661,"awaking him.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20904",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20905",22661,"At the gate we found Margheritone waiting, the same swarthy groom who","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20906",22661,"had once before been my-escort. He held the bridles of three horses, all","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20907",22661,"black like those which bore us to the castle--one for me, one for him,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20908",22661,"one for Clarimonde. Those horses must have been Spanish genets born of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20909",22661,"mares fecundated by a zephyr, for they were fleet as the wind itself,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20910",22661,"and the moon, which had just risen at our departure to light us on the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20911",22661,"way, rolled over the sky like a wheel detached from her own chariot. We","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20912",22661,"beheld her on the right leaping from tree to tree, and putting herself","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20913",22661,"out of breath in the effort to keep up with us. Soon we came upon","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20914",22661,"a level plain where, hard by a clump of trees, a carriage with four","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20915",22661,"vigorous horses awaited us. We entered it, and the postillions urged","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20916",22661,"their animals into a mad gallop. I had one arm around Clarimonde's","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20917",22661,"waist, and one of her hands clasped in mine; her head leaned upon my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20918",22661,"shoulder, and I felt her bosom, half bare, lightly pressing against","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20919",22661,"my arm. I had never known such intense happiness. In that hour I had","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20920",22661,"forgotten everything, and I no more remembered having ever been a priest","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20921",22661,"than I remembered what I had been doing in my mother's womb, so great","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20922",22661,"was the fascination which the evil spirit exerted upon me. From that","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20923",22661,"night my nature seemed in some sort to have become halved, and there","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20924",22661,"were two men within me, neither of whom knew the other. At one moment I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20925",22661,"believed myself a priest who dreamed nightly that he was a gentleman, at","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20926",22661,"another that I was a gentleman who dreamed he was a priest. I could","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20927",22661,"no longer distinguish the dream from the reality, nor could I discover","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20928",22661,"where the reality began or where ended the dream. The exquisite","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20929",22661,"young lord and libertine railed at the priest, the priest loathed the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20930",22661,"dissolute habits of the young lord. Two spirals entangled and confounded","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20931",22661,"the one with the other, yet never touching, would afford a fair","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20932",22661,"representation of this bicephalic life which I lived. Despite the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20933",22661,"strange character of my condition, I do not believe that I ever","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20934",22661,"inclined, even for a moment, to madness. I always retained with extreme","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20935",22661,"vividness all the perceptions of my two lives. Only there was one absurd","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20936",22661,"fact which I could not explain to myself--namely, that the consciousness","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20937",22661,"of the same individuality existed in two men so opposite in character.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20938",22661,"It was an anomaly for which I could not account--whether I believed","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20939",22661,"myself to be the cure of the little village of C------, or _Il Signor","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20940",22661,"Romualdo_, the titled lover of Clarimonde.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20941",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20942",22661,"Be that as it may, I lived, at least I believed that I lived, in Venice.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20943",22661,"I have never been able to discover rightly how much of illusion and how","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20944",22661,"much of reality there was in this fantastic adventure. We dwelt in a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20945",22661,"great palace on the Canaleio, filled with frescoes and statues, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20946",22661,"containing two Titians in the noblest style of the great master, which","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20947",22661,"were hung in Clarimonde's chamber. It was a palace well worthy of a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20948",22661,"king. We had each our gondola, our _barcarolli_ in family livery,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20949",22661,"our music hall, and our special poet. Clarimonde always lived upon a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20950",22661,"magnificent scale; there was something of Cleopatra in her nature. As","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20951",22661,"for me, I had the retinue of a prince's son, and I was regarded with as","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20952",22661,"much reverential respect as though I had been of the family of one of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20953",22661,"the twelve Apostles or the four Evangelists of the Most Serene Republic.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20954",22661,"I would not have turned aside to allow even the Doge to pass, and I do","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20955",22661,"not believe that since Satan fell from heaven, any creature was ever","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20956",22661,"prouder or more insolent than I. I went to the Ridotto, and played with","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20957",22661,"a luck which seemed absolutely infernal. I received the best of all","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20958",22661,"society--the sons of ruined families, women of the theatre, shrewd","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20959",22661,"knaves, parasites, hectoring swashbucklers. But notwithstanding the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20960",22661,"dissipation of such a life, I always remained faithful to Clarimonde.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20961",22661,"I loved her wildly. She would have excited satiety itself, and chained","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20962",22661,"inconstancy. To have Clarimonde was to have twenty mistresses; ay,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20963",22661,"to possess all women: so mobile, so varied of aspect, so fresh in new","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20964",22661,"charms was she all in herself--a very chameleon of a woman, in sooth.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20965",22661,"She made you commit with her the infidelity you would have committed","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20966",22661,"with another, by donning to perfection the character, the attraction,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20967",22661,"the style of beauty of the woman who appeared to please you. She","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20968",22661,"returned my love a hundred-fold, and it was in vain that the young","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20969",22661,"patricians and even the Ancients of the Council of Ten made her the most","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20970",22661,"magnificent proposals. A Foscari even went so far as to offer to espouse","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20971",22661,"her. She rejected all his overtures. Of gold she had enough. She wished","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20972",22661,"no longer for anything but love--a love youthful, pure, evoked by","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20973",22661,"herself, and which should be a first and last passion. I would have been","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20974",22661,"perfectly happy but for a cursed nightmare which recurred every night,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20975",22661,"and in which I believed myself to be a poor village cure, practising","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20976",22661,"mortification and penance for my excesses during the day. Reassured by","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20977",22661,"my constant association with her, I never thought further of the strange","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20978",22661,"manner in which I had become acquainted with Clarimonde. But the words","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20979",22661,"of the Abbe Serapion concerning her recurred often to my memory, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20980",22661,"never ceased to cause me uneasiness.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20981",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20982",22661,"For some time the health of Clarimonde had not been so good as usual;","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20983",22661,"her complexion grew paler day by day. The physicians who were summoned","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20984",22661,"could not comprehend the nature of her malady and knew not how to treat","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20985",22661,"it. They all prescribed some insignificant remedies, and never called","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20986",22661,"a second time. Her paleness, nevertheless, visibly increased, and she","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20987",22661,"became colder and colder, until she seemed almost as white and dead as","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20988",22661,"upon that memorable night in the unknown castle. I grieved with anguish","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20989",22661,"unspeakable to behold her thus slowly perishing; and she, touched by my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20990",22661,"agony, smiled upon me sweetly and sadly with the fateful smile of those","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20991",22661,"who feel that they must die.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20992",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20993",22661,"One morning I was seated at her bedside, and breakfasting from a little","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20994",22661,"table placed close at hand, so that I might not be obliged to leave her","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20995",22661,"for a single instant. In the act of cutting some fruit I accidentally","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20996",22661,"inflicted rather a deep gash on my finger. The blood immediately gushed","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20997",22661,"forth in a little purple jet, and a few drops spurted upon Clarimonde.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20998",22661,"Her eyes flashed, her face suddenly assumed an expression of savage and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"20999",22661,"ferocious joy such as I had never before observed in her. She leaped out","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21000",22661,"of her bed with animal agility--the agility, as it were, of an ape or a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21001",22661,"cat--and sprang upon my wound, which she commenced to suck with an air","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21002",22661,"of unutterable pleasure. She swallowed the blood in little mouthfuls,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21003",22661,"slowly and carefully, like a connoisseur tasting a wine from Xeres or","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21004",22661,"Syracuse. Gradually her eyelids half closed, and the pupils of her green","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21005",22661,"eyes became oblong instead of round. From time to time she paused in","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21006",22661,"order to kiss my hand, then she would recommence to press her lips to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21007",22661,"the lips of the wound in order to coax forth a few more ruddy drops.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21008",22661,"When she found that the blood would no longer come, she arose with eyes","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21009",22661,"liquid and brilliant, rosier than a May dawn; her face full and fresh,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21010",22661,"her hand warm and moist--in fine, more beautiful than ever, and in the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21011",22661,"most perfect health.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21012",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21013",22661,"'I shall not die! I shall not die!' she cried, clinging to my neck, half","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21014",22661,"mad with joy. 'I can love thee yet for a long time. My life is thine,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21015",22661,"and all that is of me comes from thee. A few drops of thy rich and noble","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21016",22661,"blood, more precious and more potent than all the elixirs of the earth,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21017",22661,"have given me back life.'","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21018",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21019",22661,"This scene long haunted my memory, and inspired me with strange","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21020",22661,"doubts in regard to Clarimonde; and the same evening, when slumber had","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21021",22661,"transported me to my presbytery, I beheld the Abbe Serapion, graver","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21022",22661,"and more anxious of aspect than ever. He gazed attentively at me, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21023",22661,"sorrowfully exclaimed: 'Not content with losing your soul, you now","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21024",22661,"desire also to lose your body. Wretched young man, into how terrible","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21025",22661,"a plight have you fallen!' The tone in which he uttered these words","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21026",22661,"powerfully affected me, but in spite of its vividness even that","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21027",22661,"impression was soon dissipated, and a thousand other cares erased it","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21028",22661,"from my mind. At last one evening, while looking into a mirror whose","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21029",22661,"traitorous position she had not taken into account, I saw Clarimonde in","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21030",22661,"the act of emptying a powder into the cup of spiced wine which she had","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21031",22661,"long been in the habit of preparing after our repasts. I took the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21032",22661,"cup, feigned to carry it to my lips, and then placed it on the nearest","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21033",22661,"article of furniture as though intending to finish it at my leisure.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21034",22661,"Taking advantage of a moment when the fair one's back was turned, I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21035",22661,"threw the contents under the table, after which I retired to my chamber","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21036",22661,"and went to bed, fully resolved not to sleep, but to watch and discover","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21037",22661,"what should come of all this mystery. I did not have to wait long,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21038",22661,"Clarimonde entered in her nightdress, and having removed her apparel,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21039",22661,"crept into bed and lay down beside me. When she felt assured that I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21040",22661,"was asleep, she bared my arm, and drawing a gold pin from her hair,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21041",22661,"commenced to murmur in a low voice:","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21042",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21043",22661,"'One drop, only one drop! One ruby at the end of my needle.... Since","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21044",22661,"thou lovest me yet, I must not die!... Ah, poor love! His beautiful","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21045",22661,"blood, so brightly purple, I must drink it. Sleep, my only treasure!","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21046",22661,"Sleep, my god, my child! I will do thee no harm; I will only take of thy","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21047",22661,"life what I must to keep my own from being for ever extinguished. But","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21048",22661,"that I love thee so much, I could well resolve to have other lovers","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21049",22661,"whose veins I could drain; but since I have known thee all other men","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21050",22661,"have become hateful to me.... Ah, the beautiful arm! How round it is!","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21051",22661,"How white it is! How shall I ever dare to prick this pretty blue vein!'","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21052",22661,"And while thus murmuring to herself she wept, and I felt her tears","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21053",22661,"raining on my arm as she clasped it with her hands. At last she took the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21054",22661,"resolve, slightly punctured me with her pin, and commenced to suck up","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21055",22661,"the blood which oozed from the place. Although she swallowed only a few","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21056",22661,"drops, the fear of weakening me soon seized her, and she carefully tied","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21057",22661,"a little band around my arm, afterward rubbing the wound with an unguent","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21058",22661,"which immediately cicatrised it. Further doubts were impossible. The","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21059",22661,"Abbe Serapion was right. Notwithstanding this positive knowledge,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21060",22661,"however, I could not cease to love Clarimonde, and I would gladly of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21061",22661,"my own accord have given her all the blood she required to sustain her","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21062",22661,"factitious life. Moreover, I felt but little fear of her. The woman","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21063",22661,"seemed to plead with me for the vampire, and what I had already heard","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21064",22661,"and seen sufficed to reassure me completely. In those days I had","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21065",22661,"plenteous veins, which would not have been so easily exhausted as at","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21066",22661,"present; and I would not have thought of bargaining for my blood, drop","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21067",22661,"by drop. I would rather have opened myself the veins of my arm and said","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21068",22661,"to her: 'Drink, and may my love infiltrate itself throughout thy body","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21069",22661,"together with my blood!' I carefully avoided ever making the least","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21070",22661,"reference to the narcotic drink she had prepared for me, or to the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21071",22661,"incident of the pin, and we lived in the most perfect harmony.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21072",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21073",22661,"Yet my priestly scruples commenced to torment me more than ever, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21074",22661,"I was at a loss to imagine what new penance I could invent in order to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21075",22661,"mortify and subdue my flesh. Although these visions were involuntary,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21076",22661,"and though I did not actually participate in anything relating to them,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21077",22661,"I could not dare to touch the body of Christ with hands so impure and a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21078",22661,"mind defiled by such debauches whether real or imaginary. In the effort","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21079",22661,"to avoid falling under the influence of these wearisome hallucinations,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21080",22661,"I strove to prevent myself from being overcome by sleep. I held my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21081",22661,"eyelids open with my fingers, and stood for hours together leaning","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21082",22661,"upright against the wall, fighting sleep with all my might; but the dust","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21083",22661,"of drowsiness invariably gathered upon my eyes at last, and finding all","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21084",22661,"resistance useless, I would have to let my arms fall in the extremity","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21085",22661,"of despairing weariness, and the current of slumber would again bear","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21086",22661,"me away to the perfidious shores. Serapion addressed me with the most","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21087",22661,"vehement exhortations, severely reproaching me for my softness and want","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21088",22661,"of fervour. Finally, one day when I was more wretched than usual, he","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21089",22661,"said to me: 'There is but one way by which you can obtain relief from","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21090",22661,"this continual torment, and though it is an extreme measure it must be","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21091",22661,"made use of; violent diseases require violent remedies. I know where","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21092",22661,"Clarimonde is buried. It is necessary that we shall disinter her","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21093",22661,"remains, and that you shall behold in how pitiable a state the object of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21094",22661,"your love is. Then you will no longer be tempted to lose your soul for","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21095",22661,"the sake of an unclean corpse devoured by worms, and ready to crumble","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21096",22661,"into dust. That will assuredly restore you to yourself.' For my part, I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21097",22661,"was so tired of this double life that I at once consented, desiring to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21098",22661,"ascertain beyond a doubt whether a priest or a gentleman had been the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21099",22661,"victim of delusion. I had become fully resolved either to kill one of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21100",22661,"the two men within me for the benefit of the other, or else to kill","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21101",22661,"both, for so terrible an existence could not last long and be endured.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21102",22661,"The Abbe Serapion provided himself with a mattock, a lever, and a","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21103",22661,"lantern, and at midnight we wended our way to the cemetery of ------,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21104",22661,"the location and place of which were perfectly familiar to him. After","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21105",22661,"having directed the rays of the dark lantern upon the inscriptions of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21106",22661,"several tombs, we came at last upon a great slab, half concealed by","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21107",22661,"huge weeds and devoured by mosses and parasitic plants, whereupon we","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21108",22661,"deciphered the opening lines of the epitaph:","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21109",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21110",22661,"     Here lies Clarimonde","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21111",22661,"     Who was famed in her life-time","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21112",22661,"     As the fairest of women.*","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21113",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21114",22661,"          * Ici git Clarimonde","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21115",22661,"          Qui fut de son vivant","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21116",22661,"          La plus belle du monde.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21117",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21118",22661,"          The broken beauty of the lines is unavoidably","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21119",22661,"          lost in the translation.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21120",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21121",22661,"'It is here without a doubt,' muttered Serapion, and placing his lantern","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21122",22661,"on the ground, he forced the point of the lever under the edge of the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21123",22661,"stone and commenced to raise it. The stone yielded, and he proceeded to","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21124",22661,"work with the mattock. Darker and more silent than the night itself, I","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21125",22661,"stood by and watched him do it, while he, bending over his dismal toil,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21126",22661,"streamed with sweat, panted, and his hard-coming breath seemed to have","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21127",22661,"the harsh tone of a death rattle. It was a weird scene, and had any","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21128",22661,"persons from without beheld us, they would assuredly have taken us","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21129",22661,"rather for profane wretches and shroud-stealers than for priests of God.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21130",22661,"There was something grim and fierce in Serapion's zeal which lent him","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21131",22661,"the air of a demon rather than of an apostle or an angel, and his great","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21132",22661,"aquiline face, with all its stern features, brought out in strong relief","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21133",22661,"by the lantern-light, had something fearsome in it which enhanced the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21134",22661,"unpleasant fancy. I felt an icy sweat come out upon my forehead in huge","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21135",22661,"beads, and my hair stood up with a hideous fear. Within the depths of my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21136",22661,"own heart I felt that the act of the austere Serapion was an abominable","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21137",22661,"sacrilege; and I could have prayed that a triangle of fire would issue","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21138",22661,"from the entrails of the dark clouds, heavily rolling above us,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21139",22661,"to reduce him to cinders. The owls which had been nestling in the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21140",22661,"cypress-trees, startled by the gleam of the lantern, flew against it","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21141",22661,"from time to time, striking their dusty wings against its panes, and","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21142",22661,"uttering plaintive cries of lamentation; wild foxes yelped in the far","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21143",22661,"darkness, and a thousand sinister noises detached themselves from the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21144",22661,"silence. At last Sera-pion's mattock struck the coffin itself, making","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21145",22661,"its planks re-echo with a deep sonorous sound, with that terrible sound","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21146",22661,"nothingness utters when stricken. He wrenched apart and tore up the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21147",22661,"lid, and I beheld Clarimonde, pallid as a figure of marble, with hands","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21148",22661,"joined; her white winding-sheet made but one fold from her head to her","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21149",22661,"feet. A little crimson drop sparkled like a speck of dew at one corner","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21150",22661,"of her colourless mouth. Serapion, at this spectacle, burst into fury:","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21151",22661,"'Ah, thou art here, demon! Impure courtesan! Drinker of blood and gold!","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21152",22661,"'And he flung holy water upon the corpse and the coffin, over which he","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21153",22661,"traced the sign of the cross with his sprinkler. Poor Clarimonde had","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21154",22661,"no sooner been touched by the blessed spray than her beautiful body","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21155",22661,"crumbled into dust, and became only a shapeless and frightful mass of","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21156",22661,"cinders and half-calcined bones.","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21157",22661,"","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21158",22661,"'Behold your mistress, my Lord Romuald!' cried the inexorable priest, as","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21159",22661,"he pointed to these sad remains. 'Will you be easily tempted after this","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21160",22661,"to promenade on the Lido or at Fusina with your beauty?' I covered my","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21161",22661,"face with my hands, a vast ruin had taken place within me. I returned","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21162",22661,"to my presbytery, and the noble Lord Romuald, the lover of Clarimonde,","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21163",22661,"separated himself from the poor priest with whom he had kept such","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21164",22661,"strange company so long. But once only, the following night, I saw","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"
"21165",22661,"Clarimonde. She said to me, as she had said the first time at the","Gautier, Théophile","Clarimonde"

"21208",NA,"It was the magic hour of dining. The long Digue of Heyst was almost deserted; so was the strip of loose, yellow sand which skirted its base, and all the tables d'htes were filling fast. Henri, the youngest waiter of the Htel Lion d'Or, was standing on the steps between the two great gilded lions which stood rampart on either side the portals, vigorously ringing a loud and discordant bell to summon the stragglers, whilst the ladies who were waiting the commencement of dinner in the little salon to the side stopped their ears to dull its clamour. Philippe and Jules were busy laying white cloths and glasses, etc., on the marble tables in the open balcony outside the salle à manger, where strangers to the Hotel might dine à la carte if they chose. Inside, the long narrow tables were decorated with dusty geraniums and fuchsias, whilst each cruet-stand had a small bunch of dirty artificial flowers tied to its handle. But the visitors to the Lion d'Or, who were mostly English, were too eager for their evening meal to cavil at their surroundings. The Baroness Gobelli, with her husband on one side and her son on the other, was the first to seat herself at table. The Baroness always appeared with the soup, for she had observed that the first comers received a more generous helping than those who came in last. No such anxiety occupied the minds of Mrs. Pullen and her friend Miss Leyton who sat opposite to the Baroness and her family. They did not care sufficiently for the potage au crouton which usually formed the beginning of the table d'hte dinner. The long tables were soon filled with a motley crew of English, Germans, and Belgians all chattering, especially the foreigners, as fast as their tongues could travel. Amongst them was a sprinkling of children, mostly unruly and ill-behaved, who had to be called to order every now and then which made Miss Leyton's lip curl with disgust. Just opposite to her, and next to Mr. Bobby Bates, the Baroness's son by her first marriage and whom she always treated as if he had been a boy of ten years old, was an unoccupied chair turned up against the table to signify that it was engaged.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21209",NA,"""I wonder if that is for the German Princess of whom Madame Lamont is so fond of talking,"" whispered Elinor Leyton to Mrs. Pullen, ""she said this morning that she expected her this afternoon.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21210",NA,"""O! surely not!"" replied her friend, ""I do not know much about royalties, but I should think a Princess would hardly dine at a public table d'hte.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21211",NA,"""O! a German Princess! what is that?"" said Miss Leyton, with a curled lip again, for she was a daughter of Lord Walthamstowe and thought very little of any aristocracy, except that of her own country.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21212",NA,"As she spoke, however, the chair opposite was sharply pulled into place and a young lady seated herself on it and looked boldly (though not brazenly) up and down the tables and at her neighbours on each side of her. She was a remarkable looking girl-more remarkable perhaps than beautiful, for her beauty did not strike one at first sight. Her figure was tall but slight and lissom. It looked almost boneless as she swayed easily from side to side of her chair. Her skin was colourless but clear. Her eyes, long-shaped, dark and narrow with heavy lids and thick black lashes which lay upon her cheeks. Her brows were arched and delicately pencilled and her nose was straight and small. Not so her mouth however which was large, with lips of a deep blood colour, displaying small white teeth. To crown all, her head was covered with a mass of soft, dull, blue-black hair, which was twisted in careless masses about the nape of her neck and looked as if it was unaccustomed to comb or hairpin. She was dressed very simply in a white cambric frock, but there was not a woman present who had not discovered in five minutes that the lace with which it was profusely trimmed was costly Valenciennes, and that it was clasped at her throat with brilliants. The new-comer did not seem in the least abashed by the numbers of eyes which were turned upon her, but bore the scrutiny very calmly, smiling in a sort of furtive way at everybody until the entrées were handed round when she riveted all her attention upon the contents of her plate. Miss Leyton thought she had never seen any young person devour her food with so much avidity and enjoyment. She could not help watch-ing her. The Baroness Gobelli, who was a very coarse feeder, scattering her food over her plate and not infrequently over the table cloth as well, was nothing compared to the young stranger.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21213",NA,"It was not so much that she ate rapidly and with evident appetite, but that she kept her eyes fixed upon her food as if she feared some one might deprive her of it. As soon as her plate was empty she called sharply to the waiter in French and ordered him to get her some more.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21214",NA,"""That's right, my dear!"" exclaimed the Baroness, nodding her huge head, and smiling broadly at the new-comer; ""make 'em bring you more! It's an excellent dish, that! I'll 'ave some more myself!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21215",NA,"As Philippe deposited the last helping of the entrée on the young lady's plate, the Baroness thrust hers beneath his nose.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21216",NA,"""'Ere!"" she said, ""bring three more 'elpings for the Baron and Bobby and me!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21217",NA,"The man shook his head to intimate that the dish was finished but the Baroness was not to be put off with a flimsy excuse. She commenced to make a row. Few meals passed without a squabble of some sort between the Hotel servants and this terrible woman.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21218",NA,"""Now we are in for it again!"" murmured Miss Leyton into Mrs. Pullen's ear. The waiter brought a different entrée, but the Baroness insisted upon having a second helping of tête de veau aux champignons.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21219",NA,"""II n'y a plus, Madame!"" asseverated Philippe, with a gesture of deprecation.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21220",NA,"""What does 'e say?"" demanded the Baroness, who was not good at French.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21221",NA,"""There is no more, mein tear!"" replied her husband, with a strong German accent.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21222",NA,"""Confound their impudence!"" exclaimed his wife with a heated countenance, ""'ere, send Monsieur 'ere at once! I'll soon see if we're not to 'ave enough to eat in 'is beastly Hotel!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21223",NA,"All the ladies who understood what she said looked horrified at such language, but that was of no consequence to Madame Gobelli who con-tinued to call out at intervals for ""Monsieur"" until she found the dinner was coming to an end without her, and thought it would be more politic to attend to business and postpone her feud till a more convenient occasion. The Baroness Gobelli was a mystery to most people in the Hotel. She was an enormous woman of the elephant build with a large, flat face and clumsy hands and feet. Her skin was coarse, so was her hair, so were her features. The only things which redeemed an otherwise repulsive face were a pair of good-humoured though cunning blue eyes and a set of firm white teeth. Who the Baroness had originally been no one could quite make out. It was evident that she must have sprung from some low origin, from her lack of education and breeding, yet she spoke familiarly of aristocratic names, even of Royal ones, and appeared to be acquainted with their families and homes. There was a floating rumour that she had been old Mr. Bates's cook before he married her, and when he left her a widow with an only child and a considerable fortune, the little German Baron had thought that her money was a fair equivalent for her personality. She was exceedingly vulgar and when roused, exceedingly vituperative, but she possessed a rough good humour when pleased and a large amount of natural shrewdness which stood her instead of cleverness. But she was an unscrupulous liar and rather boasted of the fact than otherwise. Having plenty of money at her command she was used to take violent fancies to people-taking them up suddenly, loading them with presents and favours for as long as it pleased her, and then dropping them as suddenly, without why or wherefore-even insulting them if she could not shake them off without doing so. The Baron was completely under her thumb; more than that, he was servile in her presence which aston-ished those people who did not know that amongst her other arrogant insistences, the Baroness laid claim to holding intercourse with certain supernatural and invisible beings who had the power to wreak vengeance on all those who offended her. This fear it was, combined with the fact that she had all the money and kept the strings of the bag pretty close where he was concerned, that made the Baron wait upon his wife's wishes as if he were her slave. Perhaps the softest spot in the Baroness's heart was kept for her sickly and uninteresting son, Bobby Bates, whom she treated, nevertheless, with the roughness of a tigress for her cub. She kept him still more under her surveillance than she did her husband and Bobby, though he had attained his nineteenth year, dared not say Bo! to a goose in presence of his Mamma. As the cheese was handed round Elinor Leyton rose from her seat with an impatient gesture.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21224",NA,"""Do let us get out of this atmosphere, Margaret!"" she said in a low voice. ""I really cannot stand it any longer!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21225",NA,"The two ladies left the table and went out beyond the balcony to where a number of painted iron chairs and tables were placed on the Digue for the accommodation of passing wayfarers who might wish to rest awhile and quench their thirst with limonade or lager beer.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21226",NA,"""I wonder who that girl is!"" remarked Mrs. Pullen as soon as they were out of hearing, ""I don't know whether I like her or not, but there is something rather distinguished-looking about her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21227",NA,"""Do you think so?"" said Miss Leyton, ""I thought she only distin-guished herself by eating like a cormorant! I never saw anyone in society gobble her food in such a manner! She made me positively sick!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21228",NA,"""Was it as bad as that?"" replied the more quiet Mrs. Pullen, in an indifferent manner. Her eyes were attracted just then by the perambulator which contained her baby, and she rose to meet it.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21229",NA,"""How is she, Nurse?"" she asked as anxiously as if she had not parted from the infant an hour before; ""Has she been awake all the time?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21230",NA,"""Yes, Ma'am, and looking about her like anything! But she seems inclined to sleep now! I thought it was about time to take her in!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21231",NA,"""O! no! not on such a warm lovely evening! If she does go to sleep in the open air it will do her no harm. Leave her with me! I want you to go indoors and find out the name of the young lady who sat opposite to me at dinner to-day. Philippe understands English. He will tell you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21232",NA,"""Why on earth do you want to know?"" demanded Miss Leyton, as the servant disappeared.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21233",NA,"""O! I don't know! I feel a little curious, that is all! She seems so young to be by herself!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21234",NA,"Elinor Leyton answered nothing but walked across the Digue and stood looking out over the sea. She was anticipating the arrival of her fiancé, Captain Ralph Pullen of the Limerick Rangers, but he had delayed his coming to join them and she began to find Heyst rather dull.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21235",NA,"The visitors of the Lion d'Or had finished their meal by this time and were beginning to reassemble on the Digue preparatory to taking a stroll before they turned into one of the many cafés chantants[87] which were situated at stated intervals in front of the sea. Amongst them came the Baroness Gobelli, leaning heavily on a thick stick with one hand, and her husband's shoulder with the other. The couple presented an extraordinary appearance as they perambulated slowly up and down the Digue.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21236",NA,"She-with her great height and bulk towering a head above her companion, whilst he-with a full-sized torso and short legs-a large hat crammed down upon his forehead and no neck to speak of, so that the brim appeared to rest upon his shoulders-was a ludicrous figure as he walked beside his wife, bending under the weight of her support. But yet she was actually proud of him. Notwithstanding his ill-shaped figure, the Baron possessed one of those mild German faces, with pale watery blue eyes, a long nose, and hair and beard of a reddish-golden colour, which entitled him, in the estimation of some people, to be called a handsome man and the Baroness was never tired of informing the public that his head and face had once been drawn for that of some celebrated saint.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21237",NA,"Her own appearance was really comical for though she had plenty of means her want of taste, or indifference to dress, made everyone stare at her as she passed. On the present occasion she wore a silk gown which had cost seventeen shillings a yard with a costly velvet cloak, a bonnet which might have been rescued from the dustbin, and cotton gloves with all her fingers out. She shook her thick walking stick in Miss Leyton's face as she passed by her, and called out loud enough for everyone to hear: ""And when is the handsome Captain coming to join you, Miss Leyton, eh? Take care he ain't running after some other gal! 'When pensive I thought on my L.O.V.E.' Ha! ha! ha!""[88]","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21238",NA,"Elinor flushed a delicate pink but did not turn her head nor take any notice of her tormentor. She detested the Baroness with a perfectly bitter hatred and her proud cold nature revolted from her coarseness and familiarity.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21239",NA,"""Tied to your brat again!"" cried the Baroness as she passed Margaret Pullen who was moving the perambulator gently to and fro by the handle, so as to keep her infant asleep; ""why didn't you put it in the tub as soon as it was born? It would 'ave saved you a heap of trouble! I often wish I had done so by that devil Bobby! 'Ere, where are you, Bobby?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21240",NA,"""I'm close behind you, Mamma!"" replied the simple-looking youth.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21241",NA,"""Well! don't you get running away from your father and me and winking at the gals! There's time enough for that, ain't there, Gustave?"" she concluded, addressing the Baron.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21242",NA,"""Come along Robert, and mind what your mother tells you!"" said the Herr Baron with his guttural German accent, as the extraordinary trio pursued their way down the Digue, the Baroness making audible remarks on everybody she met as they went.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21243",NA,"Margaret Pullen sat where they had left her, moving about the perambulator whilst her eyes, like Elinor's, were fixed upon the tranquil water. The August sun had now quite disappeared and the indescribably faint and unpleasant odour, which is associated with the dunes of Heyst, had begun to make itself apparent. A still languor had crept over every-thing and there were indications of a thunderstorm in the air. She was thinking of her husband, Colonel Arthur Pullen the elder brother of Miss Leyton's fiancé, who was toiling out in India for baby and herself. It had been a terrible blow to Margaret to let him go out alone after only one year of happy wedded life, but the expected advent of her little daughter at the time had prohibited her undertaking so long a journey and she had been compelled to remain behind. And now baby was six months old and Colonel Pullen hoped to be home by Christmas, so had advised her to wait for his return. But her thoughts were sad sometimes, notwith-standing.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21244",NA,"Events happen so unexpectedly in this world-who could say for certain that she and her husband would ever meet again-that Arthur would ever see his little girl, or that she should live to place her in her father's arms? But such a state of feeling was morbid, she knew, and she generally made an effort to shake it off. The nurse, returning with the information she had sent her to acquire, roused her from her reverie.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21245",NA,"""If you please, Ma'am, the young lady's name is Brandt, and Philippe says she came from London!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21246",NA,"""English! I should never have guessed it!"" observed Mrs. Pullen, ""She speaks French so well.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21247",NA,"""Shall I take the baby now, Ma'am?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21248",NA,"""Yes! Wheel her along the Digue. I shall come and meet you by and by!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21249",NA,"As the servant obeyed her orders, she called to Miss Leyton.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21250",NA,"""Elinor! come here!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21251",NA,"""What is it?"" asked Miss Leyton, seating herself beside her.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21252",NA,"""The new girl's name is Brandt and she comes from England! Would you have believed it?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21253",NA,"""I did not take sufficient interest in her to make any speculations on the subject. I only observed that she had a mouth from ear to ear, and ate like a pig! What does it concern us where she comes from?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21254",NA,"At that moment a Mrs. Montague who, with her husband, was conveying a family of nine children over to Brussels under the mistaken impression that they would be able to live cheaper there than in England, came down the Hotel steps with half a dozen of them clinging to her skirts and went straight up to Margaret Pullen.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21255",NA,"""O! Mrs. Pullen! What is that young lady's name who sat opposite to you at dinner? Everybody is asking! I hear she is enormously rich and travelling alone. Did you see the lace on her dress? Real Valenciennes, and the diamond rings she wore! Frederick says they must be worth a lot of money. She must be someone of consequence I should imagine!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21256",NA,"""On the contrary, my nurse tells me she is English and her name is Brandt. Has she no friends here?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21257",NA,"""Madame Lamont says she arrived in company with another girl, but they are located at different parts of the Hotel. It seems very strange, does it not?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21258",NA,"""And it sounds very improper!"" interposed Elinor Leyton, ""I should say the less we have to say to her the better! You never know what acquaintances you may make in a place like this! When I look up and down the table d'hte menagerie sometimes it makes me quite ill!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21259",NA,"""Does it?"" rejoined Mrs. Montague, ""I think it's so amusing! That Baroness Gobelli, for instance--""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21260",NA,"""Don't mention her before me!"" cried Miss Leyton, in a tone of disgust, ""the woman is not fit for civilized society!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21261",NA,"""She is rather common certainly, and strange in her behaviour,"" said Mrs. Montague, ""but she is very good-natured. She gave my little Edward a louis[89] yesterday. I felt quite ashamed to let him take it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21262",NA,"""That just proves her vulgarity,"" exclaimed Elinor Leyton, who had not a sixpence to give away herself, ""it shews that she thinks her money will atone for all her other shortcomings! She gave that Miss Taylor, who left last week, a valuable brooch off her own throat. And poor payment too for all the dirty things she made her do and the ridicule she poured upon her. I daresay this nouveau riche will try to curry favour with us by the same means.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21263",NA,"At that moment the girl under discussion, Miss Brandt, appeared on the balcony which was only raised a few feet above where they sat. She wore the same dress she had at dinner with the addition of a little ?eecy shawl about her shoulders. She stood smiling and looking at the ladies (who had naturally dropped all discussion about her) for a few moments, and then she ventured to descend the steps between the rampart gilded lions and almost timidly, as it seemed, took up a position near them. Mrs. Pullen felt that she could not be so discourteous as to take no notice whatever of the new-comer and so, greatly to Miss Leyton's disgust, she uttered quietly, ""Good evening!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21264",NA,"It was quite enough for Miss Brandt. She drew nearer with smiles mantling over her face.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21265",NA,"""Good evening! Isn't it lovely here?-so soft and warm, something like the Island, but so much fresher!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21266",NA,"She looked up and down the Digue, now crowded with a multitude of visitors and drew in her breath with a long sigh of content.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21267",NA,"""How gay and happy they all seem, and how happy I am too! Do you know, if I had my will, what I should like to do?"" she said, addressing Mrs. Pullen.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21268",NA,"""No! indeed!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21269",NA,"""I should like to tear up and down this road as hard as ever I could, throwing my arms over my head and screaming aloud!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21270",NA,"The ladies exchanged glances of astonishment but Margaret Pullen could not forbear smiling as she asked their new acquaintance the reason why.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21271",NA,"""O! because I am free-free at last, after ten long years of imprisonment! I am telling you the truth, I am indeed, and you would feel just the same if you had been shut up in a horrid Convent ever since you were eleven years old!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21272",NA,"At the word ""convent"", the national Protestant horror immediately spread itself over the faces of the three other ladies; Mrs. Montague gathered her flock about her and took them out of the way of possible contamination, though she would have much preferred to hear the rest of Miss Brandt's story, and Elinor Leyton moved her chair further away. But Margaret Pullen was interested and encouraged the girl to proceed.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21273",NA,"""In a convent! I suppose then you are a Roman Catholic!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21274",NA,"Harriet Brandt suddenly opened her slumbrous eyes.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21275",NA,"""I don't think so! I'm not quite sure what I am! Of course I've had any amount of religion crammed down my throat in the Convent, and I had to follow their prayers whilst there, but I don't believe my parents were Catholics! But it does not signify, I am my own mistress now. I can be what I like!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21276",NA,"""You have been so unfortunate then as to lose your parents!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21277",NA,"""O! yes! years ago, that is why my guardian, Mr. Trawler, placed me in the Convent for my education. And I've been there for ten years! Is it not a shame? I'm twenty-one now! That's why I'm free! You see,"" the girl went on confidentially, ""my parents left me everything and as soon as I came of age I entered into possession of it. My guardian, Mr. Trawler, who lives in Jamaica-did I tell you that I've come from Jamaica?-thought I should live with him and his wife when I left the Convent, and pay them for my keep, but I refused. They had kept me too tight! I wanted to see the world and life-it was what I had been looking forward to-so as soon as my affairs were settled I left the West Indies and came over here!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21278",NA,"""They said you came from England in the Hotel!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21279",NA,"""So I did! The steamer came to London and I stayed there a week before I came on here!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21280",NA,"""But you are too young to travel about by yourself, Miss Brandt! English young ladies never do so!"" said Mrs. Pullen.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21281",NA,"""I'm not by myself exactly! Olga Brimont, who was in the Convent with me, came too. But she is ill, so she's upstairs. She has come to her brother, who is in Brussels, and we travelled together. We had the same cabin on board the steamer and Olga was very ill. One night the doctor thought she was going to die! I stayed with her all the time. I used to sit up with her at night, but it did her no good. We stopped in London because we wanted to buy some dresses and things, but she was not able to go out and I had to go alone. Her brother is away from Brussels at present so he wrote her to stay in Heyst till he could fetch her, and as I had nowhere particular to go, I came with her! And she is better already! She has been fast asleep all the afternoon!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21282",NA,"""And what will you do when your friend leaves you?"" asked Mrs. Pullen.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21283",NA,"""O! I don't know! Travel about, I suppose! I shall go wherever it may please me!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21284",NA,"""Are you not going to take a walk this evening?"" demanded Elinor Leyton in a low voice of her friend, wishing to put a stop to the conversation.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21285",NA,"""Certainly! I told nurse I would join her and baby by and by!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21286",NA,"""Shall I fetch your hat then?"" enquired Miss Leyton, as she rose to go up to their apartments.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21287",NA,"""Yes! if you will dear, please, and my velvet cape in case it should turn chilly!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21288",NA,"""I will fetch mine too!"" cried Miss Brandt, jumping up with alacrity. ""I may go with you, mayn't I? I'll just tell Olga that I'm going out and be down again in five minutes!"" and without waiting for an answer, she was gone.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21289",NA,"""See what you have brought upon us!"" remarked Elinor in a vexed tone.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21290",NA,"""Well! it was not my fault,"" replied Margaret, ""and after all, what does it signify? It is only a little act of courtesy to an unprotected girl. I don't dislike her, Elinor! She is very familiar and communicative, but fancy what it must be like to find herself her own mistress, and with money at her command, after ten years' seclusion within the four walls of a convent! It is enough to turn the head of any girl. I think it would be very churlish to refuse to be friendly with her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21291",NA,"""Well! I hope it may turn out all right! But you must remember how Ralph cautioned us against making any acquaintances in a foreign hotel.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21292",NA,"""But I am not under Ralph's orders, though you may be, and I should not care to go entirely by the advice of so very fastidious and exclusive a gentleman as he is! My Arthur would never find fault with me, I am sure, for being friendly with a young unmarried girl.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21293",NA,"""Anyway, Margaret, let me entreat you not to discuss my private affairs with this new protégée of yours. I don't want to see her saucy eyes goggling over the news of my engagement to your brother-in-law!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21294",NA,"""Certainly I will not, since you ask it! But you hardly expect to keep it a secret when Ralph comes down here, do you?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21295",NA,"""Why not? Why need anyone know more than that he is your husband's brother?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21296",NA,"""I expect they know a good deal more now,"" said Margaret, laughing. ""The news that you are the Honourable Elinor Leyton and that your father is Baron Walthamstowe was known all over Heyst the second day we were here. And I have no doubt it has been succeeded by the interesting intelligence that you are engaged to marry Captain Pullen. You cannot keep servants' tongues from wagging, you know!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21297",NA,"""I suppose not!"" replied Elinor, with a moue of contempt. ""However, they will learn no more through me or Ralph. We are not ''Arry and 'Arriet' to sit on the Digue with our arms round each other's waists.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21298",NA,"""Still-there are signs and symptoms,"" said Margaret, laughing.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21299",NA,"""There will be none with us!"" rejoined Miss Leyton indignantly, as Harriet Brandt with a black lace hat on trimmed with yellow roses and a little fichu tied carelessly across her bosom, ran lightly down the steps to join them.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21300",NA,"- CHAPTER II -","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21301",NA,"The Digue was crowded by that time. All Heyst had turned out to enjoy the evening air and to partake in the gaiety of the place. A band was playing on the movable orchestra which was towed by three skinny little donkeys, day after day, from one end of the Digue to the other. To-night it was its turn to be in the middle where a large company of people was sitting on green painted chairs that cost ten centimes for hire each, whilst children danced or ran madly round and round its base. Everyone had changed his or her seaside garb for more fashionable array-even the children were robed in white frocks and gala hats-and the whole scene was gay and festive. Harriet Brandt ran from one side to the other of the Digue as though she also had been a child. Everything she saw seemed to astonish and delight her. First she was gazing out over the calm and placid water-and next she was exclaiming at the bits of rubbish in the shape of embroidered baskets, or painted shells, exhibited in the shop windows which were side by side with the private houses and hotels, forming a long line of buildings fronting the water.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21302",NA,"She kept on declaring that she wanted to buy that or this, and lamenting she had not brought more money with her.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21303",NA,"""You will have plenty of opportunities to select and purchase what you want to-morrow,"" said Mrs. Pullen, ""and you will be better able to judge what they are like. They look better under the gas than they do by daylight I can assure you, Miss Brandt!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21304",NA,"""O! but they are lovely-delightful!"" replied the girl enthusiastically. ""I never saw anything so pretty before! Do look at that little doll in a bathing costume, with her cap in one hand, her sponge in the other! She is charming-unique! Tout ce qu'il y a de plus beau!""[90]","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21305",NA,"She spoke French perfectly, and when she spoke English it was with a slightly foreign accent that greatly enhanced its charm. It made Mrs. Pullen observe:","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21306",NA,"""You are more used to speaking French than English, Miss Brandt!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21307",NA,"""Yes! We always spoke French in the Convent and it is in general use in the Island. But I thought-I hoped-that I spoke English like an English woman! I am an Englishwoman, you know!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21308",NA,"""Are you? I was not quite sure! Brandt sounds rather German!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21309",NA,"""No! my father was English, his name was Henry Brandt, and my mother was a Miss Carey-daughter of one of the Justices of Barbadoes!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21310",NA,"""O! indeed!"" replied Mrs. Pullen. She did not know what else to say. The subject was of no interest to her! At that moment they encountered the nurse and perambulator and she naturally stopped to speak to her baby.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21311",NA,"The sight of the infant seemed to drive Miss Brandt wild.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21312",NA,"""O! is that your baby Mrs. Pullen. Is that really your baby?"" she exclaimed excitedly, ""you never told me you had one. O! the darling! the sweet dear little angel! I love little white babies! I adore them. They are so sweet and fresh and clean-so different from the little niggers who smell so nasty you can't touch them! We never saw a baby in the Convent and so few English children live to grow up in Jamaica! O! let me hold her! let me carry her! I must!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21313",NA,"She was about to seize the infant in her arms, when the mother interposed.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21314",NA,"""No, Miss Brandt, please, not this evening! She is but half awake and has arrived at that age when she is frightened of strangers. Another time perhaps, when she has become used to you, but not now!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21315",NA,"""But I will be so careful of her, pretty dear!"" persisted the girl, ""I will nurse her so gently that she will fall to sleep again in my arms. Come! my little love, come!"" she continued to the baby who pouted her lips and looked as if she were going to cry.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21316",NA,"""Leave her alone!"" exclaimed Elinor Leyton in a sharp voice. ""Do you not hear what Mrs. Pullen says-that you are not to touch her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21317",NA,"She spoke so acridly that gentle Margaret Pullen felt grieved for the look of dismay that darted into Harriet Brandt's face on hearing it.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21318",NA,"""O! I am sorry-I didn't mean-"" she stammered, with a side-glance at Margaret.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21319",NA,"""Of course you did not mean anything but what was kind,"" said Mrs. Pullen. ""Miss Leyton perfectly understands that and when baby is used to you I daresay she will be very grateful for your attentions. But to-night she is sleepy and tired and perhaps a little cross. Take her home, Nurse,"" she went on, ""and put her to bed! Good-night, my sweet!"" and the peram-bulator passed them and was gone.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21320",NA,"An awkward silence ensued between the three women after this little incident. Elinor Leyton walked somewhat apart from her companions, as if she wished to avoid all further controversy, whilst Margaret Pullen sought some way by which to atone for her friend's rudeness to the young stranger. Presently they came across one of the cafés chantants which are attached to the seaside hotels, and which was brilliantly lighted up. A large awning was spread outside to shelter some dozens of chairs and tables, most of which were already occupied. The windows of the hotel salon had been thrown wide open to accommodate some singers and musicians who advanced in turn and stood on the threshold to amuse the audience. As they approached the scene a tenor in evening dress was singing a love song, whilst the musicians accompanied his voice from the salon, and the occupants of the chairs were listening with rapt attention.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21321",NA,"""How charming! How delightful!"" cried Harriet Brandt as they reached the spot, ""I never saw anything like this in the Island!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21322",NA,"""You appear never to have seen anything!"" remarked Miss Leyton, with a sneer. Miss Brandt glanced apologetically at Mrs. Pullen.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21323",NA,"""How could I see anything when I was in the Convent?"" she said. ""I know there are places of entertainment in the Island but I was never allowed to go to any. And in London there was no one for me to go with! I should so much like to go in there,"" indicating the café. ""Will you come with me, both of you I mean, and I will pay for everything! I have plenty of money you know!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21324",NA,"""There is nothing to pay my dear, unless you call for refreshment,"" was Margaret's reply.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21325",NA,"""Yes, I will go with you certainly, if you so much wish it! Elinor, you won't mind, will you?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21326",NA,"But Miss Leyton was engaged talking to a Monsieur and Mademoiselle Vieuxtemps-an old brother and sister resident in the Lion d'Or-who had stopped to wish her good-evening! They were dear, good old people, but rather monotonous and dull and Elinor had more than once ridiculed their manner of talking and voted them the most terrible bores. Mrs. Pullen concluded, therefore, that she would get rid of them as soon as courtesy permitted her to do so and follow her. With a smile and a bow therefore, to the Vieuxtemps, she pushed her way through the crowd with Harriet Brandt to where she perceived that three seats were vacant and took possession of them. They were not good seats for hearing or seeing, being to one side of the salon and quite in the shadow, but the place was so full that she saw no chance of getting any others. As soon as they were seated the waiter came round for orders, and it was with difficulty that Mrs. Pullen prevented her companion purchasing sufficient liqueurs and cakes to serve double the number of their company.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21327",NA,"""You must allow me to pay for myself, Miss Brandt,"" she said gravely, ""or I will never accompany you anywhere again!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21328",NA,"""But I have lots of money,"" pleaded the girl, ""much more than I know what to do with-it would be a pleasure to me, it would indeed!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21329",NA,"But Mrs. Pullen was resolute, and three limonades only were placed upon their table. Elinor Leyton had not yet made her appearance, and Mrs. Pullen kept craning her neck over the other seats to see where she might be, without success.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21330",NA,"""She cannot have missed us!"" she observed, ""I wonder if she can have continued her walk with the Vieuxtemps!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21331",NA,"""O! what does it signify?"" said Harriet, drawing her chair closer to that of Mrs. Pullen, ""we can do very well without her. I don't think she's very nice, do you?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21332",NA,"""You must not speak of Miss Leyton like that to me, Miss Brandt,"" remonstrated Margaret gently, ""because-she is a great friend of our family.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21333",NA,"She had been going to say, ""Because she will be my sister-in-law before long,"" but remembered Elinor's request in time and substituted the other sentence.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21334",NA,"""I don't think she's very kind though,"" persisted the other.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21335",NA,"""It is only her manner, Miss Brandt! She does not mean anything by it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21336",NA,"""But you are so different,"" said the girl as she crept still closer. ""I could see it when you smiled at me at dinner. I knew I should like you at once. And I want you to like me too-so much! It has been the dream of my life to have some friends. That is why I would not stay in Jamaica. I don't like the people there! I want friends-real friends!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21337",NA,"""But you must have had plenty of friends of your own age in the Convent.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21338",NA,"""That shews you don't know anything about a convent! It's the very last place where they will let you make a friend-they're afraid lest you should tell each other too much! The convent I was in was an Ursuline order,[91] and even the nuns were obliged to walk three and three, never two together, lest they should have secrets between them. As for us girls, we were never left alone for a single minute! There was always a sister with us, even at night, walking up and down between the row of beds, preten-ding to read her prayers but with her eyes on us the whole time and her ears open to catch what we said. I suppose they were afraid we should talk about lovers. I think girls do talk about them when they can, more in convents than in other places, though they have never had any. It would be so dreadful to be like the poor nuns, and never have a lover to the end of one's days, wouldn't it?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21339",NA,"""You would not fancy being a nun then, Miss Brandt!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21340",NA,"""I-O! dear no! I would rather be dead twenty times over! But they didn't like my coming out at all. They did try so hard to persuade me to remain with them for ever! One of them, Sister Feodore, told me I must never talk even with gentlemen if I could avoid it-that they were all wicked and nothing they said was true, and if I trusted them they would only laugh at me afterwards for my pains. But I don't believe that, do you?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21341",NA,"""Certainly not!"" replied Margaret warmly. ""The sister who told you so knew nothing about men. My dear husband is more like an angel than a man, and there are many like him. You mustn't believe such nonsense, Miss Brandt! I am sure you never heard your parents say such a silly thing!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21342",NA,"""O! my father and mother! I never remember hearing them say any-thing!"" replied Miss Brandt. She had crept closer and closer to Mrs. Pullen as she spoke, and now encircled her waist with her arm and leaned her head upon her shoulder. It was not a position that Margaret liked, nor one she would have expected from a woman on so short an acquaintance, but she did not wish to appear unkind by telling Miss Brandt to move further away. The poor girl was evidently quite unused to the ways and customs of Society, she seemed moreover very friendless and dependant-so Margaret laid her solecism down to ignorance and let her head rest where she had placed it, resolving inwardly meanwhile that she would not subject herself to be treated in so familiar a manner again.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21343",NA,"""Don't you remember your parents then?"" she asked her presently.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21344",NA,"""Hardly! I saw so little of them,"" said Miss Brandt, ""my father was a great doctor and scientist I believe, and I am not quite sure if he knew that he had a daughter!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21345",NA,"""Oh my dear, what nonsense!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21346",NA,"""But it is true, Mrs. Pullen! He was always shut up in his laboratory, and I was not allowed to go near that part of the house. I suppose he was very clever and all that-but he was too much engaged in making experiments to take any notice of me, and I am sure I never wanted to see him!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21347",NA,"""How very sad! But you had your mother to turn to for consolation and company, whilst she lived, surely?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21348",NA,"""O! my mother!"" echoed Harriet, carelessly. ""Yes! my mother! Well! I don't think I knew much more of her either. The ladies in Jamaica get very lazy you know, and keep a good deal to their own rooms. The person there I loved best of all, was old Pete, the overseer!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21349",NA,"""The overseer!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21350",NA,"""Of the estate and niggers, you know! We had plenty of niggers on the coffee plantation, regular African fellows with woolly heads and blubber lips and yellow whites to their eyes. When I was a little thing of four years old Pete used to let me whip the little niggers for a treat when they had done anything wrong. It used to make me laugh to see them wriggle their legs under the whip and cry!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21351",NA,"""O! don't, Miss Brandt!"" exclaimed Margaret Pullen, in a voice of pain.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21352",NA,"""It's true, but they deserved it you know, the little wretches, always thieving or lying or something! I've seen a woman whipped to death because she wouldn't work. We think nothing of that sort of thing over there. Still-you can't wonder that I was glad to get out of the Island. But I loved old Pete and if he had been alive when I left I would have brought him to England with me. He used to carry me for miles through the jungle on his back-out in the fresh mornings and the cool, dewy eves. I had a pony to ride but I never went anywhere without his hand upon my bridle rein. He was always so afraid lest I should come to any harm. I don't think anybody else cared. Pete was the only creature who ever loved me, and when I think of Jamaica I remember my old nigger servant as the one friend I had there!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21353",NA,"""It is very, very sad!"" was all that Mrs. Pullen could say.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21354",NA,"She had become fainter and fainter as the girl leaned against her with her head upon her breast. Some sensation which she could not define, nor account for-some feeling which she had never experienced before-had come over her and made her head reel. She felt as if something or someone were drawing all her life away. She tried to disengage herself from the girl's clasp but Harriet Brandt seemed to come after her, like a coiling snake, till she could stand it no longer and faintly exclaiming:","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21355",NA,"""Miss Brandt! let go of me, please! I feel ill!"" she rose and tried to make her way between the crowded tables, towards the open air. As she stumbled along she came against (to her great relief) her friend, Elinor Leyton.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21356",NA,"""O! Elinor!"" she gasped, ""I don't know what is the matter with me! I feel so strange, so light-headed! Do take me home!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21357",NA,"Miss Leyton dragged her through the audience and made her sit down on a bench facing the sea.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21358",NA,"""Why! what's the matter?"" demanded Harriet Brandt, who had made her way after them, ""is Mrs. Pullen ill?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21359",NA,"""So it appears,"" replied Miss Leyton, coldly, ""but how it happened you should know better than myself! I suppose it is very warm in there!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21360",NA,"""No! no! I do not think so,"" said Margaret, with a bewildered air, ""we had chairs close to the side. And Miss Brandt was telling me of her life in Jamaica when such an extraordinary sensation came over me! I can't describe it! It was just as if I had been scooped hollow!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21361",NA,"At this description Harriet Brandt burst into a loud laugh, but Elinor frowned her down.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21362",NA,"""It may seem a laughing matter to you, Miss Brandt,"" she said, in the same cold tone, ""but it is none to me. Mrs. Pullen is far from strong and her health is not to be trifled with. However, I shall not let her out of my sight again.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21363",NA,"""Don't make a fuss about it, Elinor,"" pleaded her friend. ""It was my own fault, if anyone's. I think there must be a thunderstorm in the air. I have felt so oppressed all the evening. Or is the smell from the dunes worse than usual? Perhaps I ate something at dinner that disagreed with me!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21364",NA,"""I cannot understand it at all,"" replied Miss Leyton, ""you are not used to fainting or being suddenly attacked in any way. However, if you feel able to walk let us go back to the Hotel. Miss Brandt will doubtless find someone to finish the evening with!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21365",NA,"Harriet was just about to reply that she knew no one but themselves, and to offer to take Mrs. Pullen's arm on the other side, when Elinor Leyton cut her short.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21366",NA,"""No! thank you, Miss Brandt! Mrs. Pullen would, I am sure, prefer to return to the Hotel alone with me! You can easily join the Vieuxtemps or any other of the visitors to the Lion d'Or. There is not much ceremony observed amongst the English at these foreign places. It would be better perhaps if there were a little more! Come, Margaret, take my arm and we will walk as slowly as you like! But I shall not be comfortable until I see you safe in your own room!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21367",NA,"So the two ladies moved off together leaving Harriet Brandt standing disconsolately on the Digue watching their departure. Mrs. Pullen had uttered a faint good-night to her but had made no suggestion that she should walk back with them, and it seemed to the girl as if they both in some measure blamed her for the illness of her companion. What had she done she asked herself, as she reviewed what had passed between them, that could in any way account for Mrs. Pullen's illness? She liked her so much-so very much-she had so hoped she was going to be her friend-she would have done anything, and given anything, sooner than put her to inconvenience in any way. As the two ladies moved slowly out of sight Harriet turned sadly and walked the other way. She felt lonely and disappointed. She knew no one to speak to and there was a cold empty feeling in her breast as though, in losing her hold on Margaret Pullen, she had lost something on which she had depended. Something of her feeling must have communicated itself to Margaret Pullen, for after a minute or two she stopped and said,","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21368",NA,"""I don't half like leaving Miss Brandt by herself, Elinor! She is very young to be wandering about a town by night and alone!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21369",NA,"""Nonsense!"" returned Miss Leyton, shortly, ""a young lady who can make the voyage from Jamaica to Heyst on her own account, knocking about in London for a week on the way, is surely competent to walk back to the Hotel without your assistance. I should say that Miss Brandt was a very independent young woman!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21370",NA,"""Perhaps, by nature, but she has been shut up in a convent for the best part of her life and that is not considered to be a good preparation for fighting one's way through the world!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21371",NA,"""She'll be able to fight her own battles, never fear!"" was Elinor's reply.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21372",NA,"Just then they encountered Bobby Bates, who lifted his cap as he hurried past them.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21373",NA,"""Where are you going so fast, Mr. Bates?"" said Elinor Leyton.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21374",NA,"""I am going back to the Hotel to fetch Mamma's fur boa!"" he answered.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21375",NA,"They were passing a lighted lamp at the time, and she noticed that the lad's eyes were red and his features bore traces of distress.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21376",NA,"""Are you ill?"" she enquired quickly, ""or in any trouble?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21377",NA,"He halted for a minute in his stride.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21378",NA,"""No! no! not exactly,"" he said in a low voice and then, as if the words came from him against his will, he went on, ""But O! I do wish someone would speak to Mamma about the way she treats me. It's cruel-to strike me with her stick before all those people as if I were a baby, and to call me such names! Even the servant William laughs at me! Do all mothers do the same, Miss Leyton? Ought a man to stand it quietly?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21379",NA,"""Decidedly not!"" cried Elinor, without hesitation.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21380",NA,"""O! Elinor! remember, she is his mother,"" remonstrated Margaret, ""don't say anything to set him against her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21381",NA,"""But I was nineteen last birthday,"" continued the lad, ""and sometimes she treats me in such a manner, that I can't bear it! The Baron dare not say a word to her! She swears at him so. Sometimes, I think I will run away and go to sea!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21382",NA,"""No! no! you mustn't do that!"" called Miss Leyton after him, as he quickened his footsteps in the direction of the Lion d'Or.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21383",NA,"""What an awful woman!"" sighed Mrs. Pullen. ""Fancy! striking her own son in public, and with that thick stick too. I believe he had been crying!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21384",NA,"""I am sure he had,"" replied her friend, ""you can see the poor fellow is half-witted and very weakly into the bargain. I suppose she has beaten his brains to a pap. What a terrible misfortune to have such a mother! You should hear some of the stories Madame Lamont has to tell of her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21385",NA,"""But how does she hear them?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21386",NA,"""Through the Baron's servant William, I suppose. He says the Baroness has often taken her stick to him and the other servants and thinks no more of swearing at them than a trooper! They all hate her. One day she took up a kitchen cleaver and advanced upon her coachman with it, but he seized her by both arms and sat her down upon the fire, whence she was only rescued after being somewhat severely burned!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21387",NA,"""It served her right!"" exclaimed Margaret, laughing at the ludicrous idea, ""but what a picture she must have presented, seated on the kitchen range! Where can the woman have been raised? What sort of a person can she be?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21388",NA,"""Not what she pretends, Margaret, you may be sure of that! All her fine talk of lords and ladies is so much bunkum. But I pity the poor little Baron who is, at all events, inoffensive. How can he put up with such a wife! He must feel very much ashamed of her sometimes!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21389",NA,"""And yet he seems devoted to her! He never leaves her side for a moment. He is her walking stick, her fetcher and carrier, and her scribe. I don't believe she can write a letter!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21390",NA,"""And yet she was talking at the table d'hte yesterday of the Duke of This and the Earl of That, and hinting at her having stayed at Osborne and Windsor. Of course they are falsehoods! She has never seen the inside of a palace unless it was in the capacity of a charwoman! Have you observed her hair? It is as coarse as a horse tail? And her hands! Bobby informed me the other day that his Mamma took nines in gloves! She's not a woman, my dear! She's a female elephant!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21391",NA,"Margaret was laughing still, when they reached the steps of the Lion d'Or.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21392",NA,"""You are very naughty and very scandalous, Elinor,"" she said, ""but you have done me a world of good. My unpleasant feelings have quite gone. I am quite capable of continuing our walk if you would like to do so.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21393",NA,"""No such thing, Madam,"" replied Miss Leyton, ""I am responsible for your well-doing in Arthur's absence. Upstairs and into bed you go, unless you would like a cup of coffee and a chasse first. That is the only indulgence I can grant you.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21394",NA,"But Mrs. Pullen declined the proffered refreshment and the two ladies sought their rooms in company.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21395",NA,"- CHAPTER III -","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21396",NA,"The next morning dawned upon a perfect August day. The sun streamed brightly over every part of Heyst, turning the loose dry yellow sand (from end to end of which not a stone or boulder was to be seen) into a veritable cloth of gold. The patient asses, carrying their white-covered saddles and tied to stakes, were waiting in a row for hire, whilst some dozen Rosinantes, called by courtesy, horses, were also of the company. The sands were already strewn with children, their short petti-coats crammed into a pair of bathing drawers and their heads protected by linen hats or bonnets, digging away at the dry sand as if their lives depended on their efforts. The bathing machines, painted in gay stripes of green, red, blue, or orange, were hauled down ready for action, and the wooden tents, which can be hired for the season at any foreign watering place, were being swept out and arranged for the day's use.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21397",NA,"Some of the more pretentious ones belonging to private families were surmounted by a gilt coronet, the proud possession of the Comte Darblaye, or the Herr Baron Grumplestein-sported flags moreover of France or Germany and were screened from the eyes of the vulgar by lace or muslin curtains tied up with blue ribbons. On the balcony of the Lion d'Or, where the visitors always took their breakfast, were arranged tables piled with dishes of crevettes fresh from the sea, pistolets,[92] and beautiful butter as white and tasteless as cream. It was a delight to breakfast on the open balcony with the sea breeze blowing in one's face, and in the intervals of eating prawns and bread and butter or perusing the morning papers, to watch the cheerful scene below.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21398",NA,"The Baroness was there, early, of course. She and her husband and the ill-used Bobby occupied a table to themselves whence she addressed her remarks to whomever she chose, whether they wished to listen or not, and the Baron shelled her crevettes and buttered her pistolets for her. Margaret and Elinor were rather later than usual for Mrs. Pullen had not passed a good night and Miss Leyton would not have her disturbed.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21399",NA,"Harriet Brandt was there as they appeared and beside her a pale, unhealthy-looking young woman whom she introduced as her friend and travelling companion, Olga Brimont.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21400",NA,"""Olga did not wish to come down. She thought she would lie another day in bed, but I made her get up and dress, and I was right, wasn't I, Mrs. Pullen?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21401",NA,"""I think the fresh air will do Mademoiselle Brimont more good than the close bedroom, if she is strong enough to stand it!"" replied Margaret, with a smile. ""I am afraid you are still feeling weak,"" she continued to the new-comer.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21402",NA,"""I feel better than I did on board the steamer or in London,"" said Mademoiselle Brimont. She was an under-sized girl with plain features, and did not shew off to advantage beside her travelling companion.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21403",NA,"""Did you suffer so much from sea-sickness? I can sympathise with you, as I am a very bad sailor myself!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21404",NA,"""O! no! Madame, it was not the mal de mer. I can hardly tell you what it was. Miss Brandt and I occupied a small cabin together, and perhaps it was because it was so small, but I did not feel as if I could breathe there-such a terrible oppression as though some one were sitting on my chest-and such a general feeling of emptiness. It was the same in London, though Miss Brandt did all she could for me, indeed she sat up with me all night till I feared she would be ill herself-but I feel better now! Last night I slept for the first time since leaving Jamaica!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21405",NA,"""That is right! You will soon get well in this lovely air!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21406",NA,"They all sat down at the same table and commenced to discuss their rolls and coffee. Margaret Pullen, glancing up once, was struck by the look with which Harriet Brandt was regarding her-it was so full of yearning affection-almost of longing to approach her nearer, to hear her speak, to touch her hand! It amused her to observe it! She had heard of cases in which young unsophisticated girls had taken unaccountable affections for members of their own sex and trusted she was not going to form the subject for some such experience on Miss Brandt's part. The idea made her address her conversation more to Mademoiselle Brimont than to her companion of the evening before.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21407",NA,"""I suppose you and Miss Brandt were great friends in the Convent,"" she said.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21408",NA,"""O! no, Madame, we hardly ever saw each other whilst there except in chapel. There is so much difference in our ages, I am only seventeen and was in the lower school, whilst Miss Brandt did hardly any lessons during the last two years she spent there. But I was very glad to have her company across to England. My brother would have sent for me last year if he could have heard of a lady to travel with me!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21409",NA,"""Are you going on to join your brother soon?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21410",NA,"""He says he will fetch me, Madame, as soon as he can be spared from his business. He is my only relation. My parents died, like Miss Brandt's, in the West Indies.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21411",NA,"""Well! you must be sure and get your looks back before he arrives!"" said Margaret, kindly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21412",NA,"The head waiter now appeared with the letters from England, amongst which was one for Miss Leyton in a firm, manly handwriting with a regimental crest in blue and gold upon the envelope. Her face did not change in the least as she broke the seal, although it came from her fiancé, Captain Ralph Pullen. Elinor Leyton's was an exceptionally cold face and it matched her disposition. She had attractive features;-a delicate nose, carved as if in ivory-brown eyes, a fair rose-tinted complexion and a small mouth with thin, firmly closed lips. Her hair was bronze-coloured and it was always dressed to perfection. She had a good figure too, with small hands and feet-and she was robed in excellent taste. She was pre-eminently a woman for a man to be proud of as the mistress of his house and the head of his table. She might be trusted never to say or do an unladylike thing-before all, she was cognisant of the obligations which devolved upon her as the daughter of Lord Walthamstowe and a member of the British aristocracy. But in disposition she was undoubtedly cold, and her fiancé had already begun to find it out. Their engagement had come about neither of them quite knew how, but he liked the idea of being connected with an aristocratic family, and she was proud of having won a man for whom many caps had been pulled in vain. He was considered to be one of the handsomest men of his generation, and she was what people called an unexceptional match for him. She was fond of him in her way, but her way was a strange one. She called the attitude she assumed towards him a proper and ladylike reserve but impartial spectators, with stronger feelings, would have deemed it indifference.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21413",NA,"However, like the proverbial dog in the manger, whether she valued her rights in Captain Pullen or not, Miss Leyton had no intention of permitting them to be interfered with. She would have died sooner than admit that he was necessary to her happiness. At the same time she considered it due to her dignity as a woman never to give in to his wishes when they opposed her own, and often when they did not.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21414",NA,"She displayed no particular enthusiasm when they met, nor distress when they parted-neither was she ever troubled by any qualms lest during their frequent separations he should meet some woman whom he might perchance prefer to herself. They were engaged, and when the proper time came they would marry-meanwhile their private affairs concerned no one but themselves. In short, Elinor Leyton was not what is termed ""a man's woman""-all her friends (if she had any) were of her own sex.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21415",NA,"Having perused her letter she refolded and replaced it in its envelope without a glance in the direction of Mrs. Pullen. Margaret thought she had a right to be informed of her brother-in-law's movements. She had invited Miss Leyton to accompany her to Heyst at his request, and any prepar-ations which might be requisite before he joined them would have to be made by herself.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21416",NA,"""Is that from Ralph? What does he say?"" she enquired in a low voice.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21417",NA,"""Nothing in particular!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21418",NA,"""But when may we expect him at Heyst?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21419",NA,"""Next week, he says, in time for the Bataille des Fleurs!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21420",NA,"""Are you not pleased?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21421",NA,"""Of course I am!"" replied Elinor, but without a sparkle or blush.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21422",NA,"""O! if it were only my Arthur that were coming!"" exclaimed Margaret, fervently, ""I should go mad with joy!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21423",NA,"""Then it is just as well perhaps that it is not your Arthur!"" rejoined her companion, as she put the letter into her pocket.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21424",NA,"""Now, Bobby,"" announced the strident tones of the Baroness Gobelli from the other side of the balcony, ""leave off picking the shrimps! You've 'ad more than enough! Ain't bread and butter good enough for you? What'll you want next?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21425",NA,"""But Mamma,"" pleaded the youth, ""I've only had a few! I've been shelling Papa's all this time!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21426",NA,"""Put 'em down at once, I say!"" reiterated the Baroness, ""'ere William, take Bobby's plate away! He's 'ad plenty for this morning!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21427",NA,"""But I haven't begun yet. I'm hungry!"" remonstrated Bobby.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21428",NA,"""Take 'is plate away!"" roared the Baroness. ""'Ang it all! Can't you 'ear what I say?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21429",NA,"""Mein tear! mein tear!"" ejaculated the Herr Baron in a subdued voice.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21430",NA,"""Leave me alone, Gustave! Do you suppose I can't manage my own son? He ain't yours! 'E'd make 'imself ill if I didn't look after 'im. Take 'is plate away, at once!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21431",NA,"The man-servant William lifted the plate of peeled shrimps and bread and butter from the table, whilst Bobby with a very red face rose from his seat and rushed down the steps to the beach.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21432",NA,"""He! he! he!"" cackled the Baroness, ""that'll teach 'im not to fiddle with 'is food another time! Bobby don't care for an empty belly!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21433",NA,"""What a shame!"" murmured Margaret, who was nothing if she was not a mother, ""now the poor boy will go without his breakfast.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21434",NA,"Presently William was to be seen sneaking past the Hotel with a parcel in his hands. The Baroness pounced upon him like a cat upon a mouse.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21435",NA,"""William!"" she cried from the balcony, ""what 'ave you got in your 'and?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21436",NA,"""Summat of my own, my lady!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21437",NA,"""Bring it 'ere!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21438",NA,"The man mounted the steps and stood before his mistress. He held a parcel in his hands wrapped up in a table napkin.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21439",NA,"""Open that parcel!"" said the Baroness.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21440",NA,"""Indeed, my lady, it's only the shrimps as Master Robert left behind him and I thought they would make me a little relish on the sands, my lady!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21441",NA,"""Open that parcel!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21442",NA,"William obeyed, and disclosed the rolls and butter and peeled shrimps just as Bobby had left them.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21443",NA,"""You were going to take 'em down to Bobby on the beach!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21444",NA,"""No, indeed, my lady!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21445",NA,"""Confound you, Sir, don't you lie to me!"" exclaimed the Baroness, shaking her stick in his face. ""I've ways and means of finding out things that you know nothing of! Throw that stuff into the road!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21446",NA,"""But, my lady--""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21447",NA,"""Throw it into the road at once or you may take your month's warning! 'Ang it all! are you the mistress, or am I?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21448",NA,"The servant threw a glance of enquiry in the direction of the Herr Baron, but the Herr Baron kept his face well down in his plate, so after a pause, he walked to the side and shook the contents of the napkin upon the Digue.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21449",NA,"""And now don't you try any more of your tricks upon me or I'll thrash you till your own mother won't know you! You leave Bobby alone for the future, or it'll be the worst day's work you ever did! Remember that!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21450",NA,"""Very good, my lady!"" replied William, but as he left the balcony he gave a look at the other occupants which well conveyed his feelings on the subject.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21451",NA,"""I should not be surprised to hear that that woman had been murdered by her servants some day!"" said Margaret to Elinor Leyton.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21452",NA,"""No! and I should not be sorry! I feel rather like murdering her myself. But let us go down to the sands, Margaret, and try to find the disconsolate Bobby! I'm not afraid of his mother if William is, and if he wants something to eat I shall give it him!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21453",NA,"They fetched their hats and parasols, and having left the Hotel by a side entrance, found their way down to the sands. It was a pretty sight there and in some cases, a comical one. The bathing machines were placed some sixty or more feet from the water, according to the tide, and their occupants, clad in bathing costumes, had to run the gauntlet of all the eyes upon the beach as they traversed that distance in order to reach the sea. To some visitors, especially the English ones, this ordeal was rather trying. To watch them open a crevice of the machine door and regard the expectant crowd with horror;-then after some hesitation, goaded on by the cries of the bathing women that the time was passing, to see them emerge with reluctant feet, sadly conscious of their unclothed condition, and of the unsightly corns and bunions which disfigured their feet-to say nothing of the red and blue tint which their skin had suddenly assumed-was to find it almost impossible to refrain from laughter.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21454",NA,"The very skinny and knuckle-kneed ones; the very fat and bulging ones; the little fair men who looked like Bobby's peeled shrimps, and the muscular black and hairy ones who looked like bears escaped from a menagerie-these types and many others our ladies could not help being amused at, though they told each other it was very improper all the time. But everybody had to pass through the same ordeal and everybody submitted to it, and tried to laugh off their own humiliation by ridiculing the appearance of their neighbours. Margaret and Elinor were never tired of watching the antics of the Belgians and Germans whilst they were (what they called) bathing. The fuss they made over entering two feet of water-the way in which they gasped and puffed as they caught it up in their hands and rubbed their backs and chests with it-the reluctance with which the ladies were dragged by their masculine partners into the briny, as if they expected to be overwhelmed and drowned by the tiny waves which rippled over their toes, and made them catch their breath. And lastly, when they were convinced there was no danger, to see them, men and women, fat and thin, take hands and dance round in a ring as if they were playing at ""Mulberry Bush"" was too delightful. But if one bather, generally an Englishman more daring than his fellows, went in for a good swim, the coast-guardsmen ran along the breakwater shouting ""Gare, gare!"" until he came out again.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21455",NA,"""They are funnier than ever to-day,"" remarked Margaret, after a while. ""I wonder what they will say when they see Ralph swimming out next week. They will be frightened to death. All the Pullens are wonderful swimmers. I have seen Anthony Pennell perform feats in the water that made my blood run cold! And Ralph is famous for his diving!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21456",NA,"The topic did not appear to interest Elinor. She reverted to the subject of Anthony.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21457",NA,"""Is that the literary man-the cousin?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21458",NA,"""Yes! Have you not met him?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21459",NA,"""Never!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21460",NA,"""I am sure you would like him! He is such a fine fellow! Not such a 'beauty man' as Ralph, perhaps, but quite as tall and stalwart! His last book was a tremendous success!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21461",NA,"""Ralph has never mentioned him to me, though I knew he had a cousin of that name!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21462",NA,"""Well!-if you won't be offended at my saying so-Ralph has always been a little jealous of Anthony, at least so Arthur says. He outstripped him at school and college and the feeling had its foundation there. And anyone might be jealous of him now! He has shewn himself to be a genius!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21463",NA,"""I don't like geniuses as a rule,"" replied Elinor, ""they are so conceited. I believe that is Bobby Bates sitting out there on the breakwater! I will go and see if he is still hungry!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21464",NA,"""Give the poor boy a couple of francs to get himself a breakfast in one of the restaurants,"" said Margaret, ""he will enjoy having a little secret from his terrible Mamma!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21465",NA,"She had not been alone long before the nurse came up to her with the perambulator, piled up with toys but no baby. Margaret's fears were excited at once.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21466",NA,"""Nurse! nurse, what is the matter? Where is the baby?"" she exclaimed in tones of alarm.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21467",NA,"""Nothing's the matter, Ma'am! pray don't frighten yourself!"" replied the servant. ""It's only that the young ladies have got baby and they've bought her all these toys and sent me on to tell you that they would be here directly!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21468",NA,"The perambulator was filled with expensive play things useless for an infant of six months old. Dolls, woolly sheep, fur cats, and gaily coloured balls with a huge box of chocolates and caramels, were piled one on the top of the other. But Mrs. Pullen's face expressed nothing but annoyance.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21469",NA,"""You had no right to let them take her, Nurse-you had no right to let the child out of your sight! Go back at once and bring her here to me! I am exceedingly annoyed about it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21470",NA,"""Here are the young ladies, Ma'am, and you had better lay your orders on them yourself, for they wouldn't mind me,"" said the nurse somewhat sullenly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21471",NA,"In another minute Harriet Brandt and Olga Brimont had reached her side, the former panting under the weight of the heavy infant, but with her face scarlet with the excitement of having captured her.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21472",NA,"""O! Miss Brandt!"" cried Margaret, ""you have given me such a fright! You must never take baby away from her nurse again, please! As I told you last night she is afraid of strangers, and generally cries when they try to take her! Come to me, my little one!"" she continued, holding out her arms to the child, ""come to mother and tell her all about it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21473",NA,"But the baby seemed to take no notice of the fond appeal. It had its big eyes fixed upon Miss Brandt's face with a half-awed, half-interested expression.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21474",NA,"""O! no! don't take her away!"" said Harriet eagerly. ""She is so good with me! I assure you she is not frightened in the least bit, are you my little love?"" she added, addressing the infant. ""And nurse tells me her name is Ethel, so I have ordered them to make her a little gold bangle with 'Ethel' on it, and she must wear it for my sake, darling little creature!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21475",NA,"""But, Miss Brandt, you must not buy such expensive things for her, indeed. She is too young to appreciate them, besides I do not like you to spend so much money on her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21476",NA,"""But why shouldn't I? What am I to do with my money if I may not spend it on others?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21477",NA,"""But, such a quantity of toys! Surely you have not bought all these for my baby!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21478",NA,"""Of course I have! I would have bought the whole shop if it would have pleased her! She likes the colours! Little darling! look how earnestly she gazes at me with her lovely grey eyes, as if she knew what a little beauty I think her! O! you pretty dear! you sweet pink and white baby!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21479",NA,"Mrs. Pullen felt somewhat annoyed as she saw the dolls and furry animals which were strewn upon the sands. At the same time she was flattered by the admiration exhibited of her little daughter, and the endearments lavished upon her. She considered them all well deserved (as what mother would not?)-and it struck her that Harriet Brandt must be a kindhearted as well as a generous girl to spend so much money on a stranger's child.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21480",NA,"""She certainly does seem wonderfully good with you,"" she observed presently. ""I never knew her so quiet with anybody but her nurse or me before. Isn't it marvellous, Nurse?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21481",NA,"""It is, Ma'am! Baby do seem to take surprisingly to the young lady! And perhaps I might go into the town, as she is so quiet, and get the darning wool for your stockings!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21482",NA,"""O! no! no! We must not let Miss Brandt get tired of holding her. She is too heavy to be nursed for long!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21483",NA,"""Indeed, indeed she is not!"" cried Harriet, ""do let me keep her, Mrs. Pullen, whilst nurse goes on her errand. It is the greatest pleasure to me to hold her. I should like never to give her up again!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21484",NA,"Margaret smiled.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21485",NA,"""Very well, Nurse, since Miss Brandt is so kind, you can go!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21486",NA,"As the servant disappeared, she said to Harriet, ""Mind! you give her to me directly she makes your arm ache! I am more used to the little torment than you are.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21487",NA,"""How can you call her by such a name, even in fun? What would I not give to have a baby of my very own to do what I liked with? I would never part with it, night nor day. I would teach it to love me so much that it should never be happy out of my sight!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21488",NA,"""But that would be cruel, my dear! Your baby might have to part with you, as you have had to part with your mother!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21489",NA,"At the mention of her mother something came into Miss Brandt's eyes which Margaret could not define. It was not anger, nor sorrow, nor remorse. It was a kind of sullen contempt. It was some thing that made Mrs. Pullen resolve not to allude to the subject again. The incident made her examine Harriet's eyes more closely than she had done before. They were beautiful in shape and colour, but they did not look like the eyes of a young girl. They were deeply, impenetrably black-with large pellucid pupils, but there was no sparkle nor brightness in them, though they were underlaid by smouldering fires which might burst forth into flame at any moment, and which seemed to stir and kindle and then go out again when she spoke of anything that interested her. There was an attraction about the girl which Mrs. Pullen acknowledged without wishing to give in to. She could not keep her eyes off her! She seemed to hypnotise her as the snake is said to hypnotise the bird, but it was an unpleasant feeling, as if the next moment the smouldering fire would burst forth into flame and overwhelm her. But watching her play with, and hearing her talk to her baby, Margaret put the idea away from her and only thought how kindly natured she must be to take so much trouble for another woman's child. It was not long before Miss Leyton found her way back to them and as her glance fell upon Harriet Brandt and the baby she elevated her eyebrows.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21490",NA,"""Where is the nurse?"" she demanded, curtly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21491",NA,"""She has gone to the shops to see if she can get some darning wool and Miss Brandt was kind enough to offer to keep baby for her till she returns. And O! Elinor, look what beautiful toys Miss Brandt has bought her! Isn't she too kind?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21492",NA,"""Altogether too kind!"" responded Elinor. ""By the way, Margaret, I found our friend and transacted the little business we spoke of! But he says his Mamma has ordered him to remain here till she comes down to see him bathe, and dry him I suppose with her own hands! And do I not descry her fairy feet indenting the sands at this very moment and bearing down in our direction?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21493",NA,"""You could hardly mistake her for anybody else!"" replied Mrs. Pullen.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21494",NA,"In another minute the Baroness was upon them.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21495",NA,"""Hullo,"" she called out, ""you're just in time to see Gustave bathe! He looks lovely in his bathing costume! His legs are as white as your baby's, Mrs. Pullen, and twice as well worth looking at!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21496",NA,"""Mein tear! mein tear!"" remonstrated the Baron.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21497",NA,"""Don't be a fool, Gustave! You know it's the truth! And the loveliest feet, Miss Leyton! Smaller than yours I bet. Where's that devil, Bobby? I'm going to give 'im a dousing for his villainy this morning I can tell you! Once I get 'is 'ead under water it won't come up again in a hurry! I expect 'e's pretty 'ungry by this time! But 'e don't get a centime out of me for cakes to-day. I'll teach 'im not to stuff 'imself like a pig again. Come, Gustave! 'ere's a machine for you! Get me a chair that I may sit outside it! Now we'll 'ave some fun,"" she added, with a wink at Mrs. Pullen.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21498",NA,"""Let us move on to the breakwater!"" said Margaret to Elinor Leyton, and the whole party got up and walked some little distance off.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21499",NA,"""Ah! you don't hoodwink me!"" screamed the Baroness after them.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21500",NA,"""You've got glasses with you, and you're going to 'ave a good squint at Gustave's legs through 'em, I know! You'd better 'ave stayed 'ere, like honest women, and said you enjoyed the sight!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21501",NA,"""O! Margaret!"" said Miss Leyton, with a look of horror. ""If it had not been for the Bataille des Fleurs and . . . . the other thing. . . . I should have said, for goodness' sake, let us move on to Ostende or Blankenburghe with the least possible delay. That woman will be the death of me yet! I'm sure she will!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21502",NA,"Notwithstanding which, they could not help laughing in concert a little later on to see the unwilling Bobby dragged down by William to bathe, and as he emerged from his machine, helpless and half naked, to watch his elephantine mother chase him with her stout stick in hand, and failing to catch him in time, slip on the wet sand and flounder in the waves herself, from which plight it looked very much as though her servant instead of rescuing her did his best to push her further in before he dragged her, drenched and disordered, on dry land again.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21503",NA,"- CHAPTER IV -","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21504",NA,"The Baroness Gobelli's temperament was as inconsistent as her dress. Under the garb of jocose good-humour, which often degenerated to horse play, she concealed a jealous and vindictive disposition which would go any lengths, when offended, to revenge itself. She was wont to say that she never forgot nor forgave an injury, and that when she had her knife (as she termed it) in a man she knew how to bide her time, but that when the time came, she turned it. These bloodthirsty sentiments, coupled with an asseveration which was constantly on her lips, that when she willed the death of anyone he died, and that she had powers at her command of which no one was aware but herself, frightened many timid and ignorant people into trying to propitiate so apparently potent a mortal, and generally kowtooing before her. To such votaries, so long as they pleased her, Madame Gobelli was used to shew her favour by various gifts of dresses, jewelry, or money, according to their circumstances, for in some cases she was lavishly generous but she soon tired of her acquaint-ances and replaced them by fresh favourites.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21505",NA,"The hints that she gave forth regarding herself and her antecedents, were too extraordinary to gain credence except from the most ignorant of her auditors, but the Baroness always spoke in parables and left no proof of what she meant, to be brought up against her. This proved that if she were clever, she was still more cunning. The hints she occasionally gave of being descended from Royal blood, though on the wrong side of the blanket, and of the connection being acknowledged privately if not publicly by the existing members of the reigning family, were received with open mouths by people of her own class but rejected with scorn by such as were acquainted with those whom she affected to know. It was remarkable also, and only another proof that whatever her real birth and antecedents the Baroness Gobelli was unique, that notwithstanding her desire to be considered noble by birth if not by law, she never shirked the fact that the Baron was in trade-on the contrary she rather made a boast of it and used to relate stories bringing it into ridicule with the greatest gusto. The fact being that Baron Gobelli was the head of a large firm of export bootmakers trading in London under the name of Fantaisie et Cie, the boots and shoes of which, though professedly French, were all manufactured in Germany where the firm maintained an enormous factory. The Baroness could seldom be in the company of anyone for more than five minutes without asking them where they bought their boots and shoes, and recommending them to Fantaisie et Cie as the best makers in London. She wanted to be first in everything-in popularity, in notice, and in conversation-if she could not attract attention by her personality she startled people by her vulgarity-if she could not reign supreme by reason of her supposed birth, she would do so by boots and shoes if nothing else-and if anybody slighted her or appeared to discredit her statements, he or she was immediately marked down for retaliation.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21506",NA,"Harriet Brandt had not been many days in Heyst before the Baroness had become jealous of the attention which she paid Mrs. Pullen and her child. She saw that the girl was attractive, she heard that she was rich, and she liked to have pretty and pleasant young people about her when at home-they drew men to the house and reflected a sort of credit upon herself-and she determined to get Harriet away from Margaret Pullen and chain her to her own side instead. The Baroness hated Miss Leyton quite as much as Elinor hated her. She was quick of hearing and very intuitive-she had caught more than one of the young lady's uncomplimentary remarks upon herself, and had divined still more than she had heard. She had observed her sympathy with Bobby also, and that she encouraged him in his boyish rebellion. For all these reasons, she ""had her knife"" into Miss Leyton and was waiting her opportunity to turn it. And she foresaw-with the assistance perhaps of the Powers of Darkness, of whose acquaintance she was so proud-that she would be enabled to take her revenge on Elinor Leyton through Harriet Brandt.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21507",NA,"But her first advances to the latter were suavity itself. She was not going to frighten the girl by shewing her claws until she had stroked her down the right way with her pattes de velours.[93]","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21508",NA,"She came upon her one morning as she sat upon the sands with little Ethel in her arms. The nurse was within speaking distance, busy with her needlework, and the infant seemed so quiet with Miss Brandt and she took such evident pleasure in nursing it, that Mrs. Pullen no longer minded leaving them together, and had gone for a stroll with Miss Leyton along the Digue. So the Baroness found Harriet, comparatively speaking, alone.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21509",NA,"""So you're playing at nursemaid again!"" she commenced in her abrupt manner. ""You seem to have taken a wonderful fancy to that child!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21510",NA,"""She is such a good little creature,"" replied Harriet, ""she is no trouble whatever. She sleeps half the day!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21511",NA,"Miss Brandt had a large box of chocolates beside her into which she continually dipped her hand. Her mouth, too, was stained with the delicate sweet meat-she was always eating either fruit or bonbons. She handed the box now, with a timid air, to the Baroness.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21512",NA,"""Do you care for chocolate, Madame?"" she asked.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21513",NA,"The Baroness did not like to be called ""Madame"" according to the French fashion. She thought it derogated from her dignity. She wished every one to address her as ""my lady,"" and considered she was cheated out of her rights when it was omitted. But she liked chocolate almost as well as Harriet did.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21514",NA,"""Thank you! I'll 'ave a few!"" she said, grabbing about a dozen in her huge hand at the first venture. ""What a liking for candies the Amurricans seem to 'ave introduced into England! I can remember the time when you never saw such a thing as sweets in the palace-I don't think they were allowed-and now they're all over the place. I shouldn't wonder if Her Majesty hasn't a box or two in her private apartments, and as for the Princesses, well-!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21515",NA,"""The Palace!-Her Majesty!""-echoed Miss Brandt, opening her dark eyes very wide.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21516",NA,"""As I tell 'em,"" continued the Baroness, ""they won't 'ave a tooth left amongst the lot of 'em soon! What are you staring at?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21517",NA,"""But-but-do you go to the Queen's palace?"" demanded Harriet, incredulously, as well she might.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21518",NA,"""Not unless I'm sent for, you may take your oath! I ain't fond enough of 'em for all that; besides, Windsor's 'orribly damp and don't suit me at all. But you mustn't go and repeat what I tell you in the Hotel. It might give offence in high places if I was known to talk of it. You see there's some of 'em has never seen me since I married the Baron! Being in trade they thought 'e wasn't good enough for me! I've 'eard that when Lady Morton-the dowager Countess, you know-was asked if she 'ad seen me lately, she called out loud enough for the whole room to 'ear, 'Do you mean the woman that married the boot man? No! I 'aven't seen 'er, and I don't mean to either!' Ha! ha! ha! But I can afford to laugh at all that, my dear!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21519",NA,"""But-I don't quite understand!"" said Harriet Brandt, with a bewildered look.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21520",NA,"""Why! the Baron deals in shoe-leather! 'Aven't you 'eard it? I suppose we've got the largest manufactory in Germany! Covers four acres of ground, I give you my word!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21521",NA,"""Shoe-leather!"" again ejaculated Harriet Brandt, not knowing what to say.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21522",NA,"""Why, yes! of course all the aristocracy go in for trade now-adays! It's the fashion! There's the Viscountess Gormsby keeps a bonnet shop, and Lord Charles Snowe 'as a bakery, and Lady Harrison 'as an old curiosity shop and stands about it dusting tables and chairs all day! But how can you know anything about it, just coming from the West Indies and all those 'orrid blacks! Ain't you glad to find yourself amongst Christians again?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21523",NA,"""This is the first time I ever left Jamaica,"" said Miss Brandt, ""I was born there.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21524",NA,"""But you won't die there, or I'm much mistaken! You're too good to be wasted on Jamaica! When are you going back to England?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21525",NA,"""O! I don't know! I've hardly thought about it yet! Not while Mrs. Pullen stays here though!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21526",NA,"""Why! you're not tied to 'er apron-string, surely! What's she to you?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21527",NA,"""She is very kind and I have no friends!"" replied Miss Brandt.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21528",NA,"The Baroness burst into a coarse laugh.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21529",NA,"""You won't want for friends once you shew your face in England, I can tell you. I'd like to 'ave you at our 'ouse, the Red 'Ouse we call it. Princess-but there, I mustn't tell you 'er name or it'll go through the Hotel, and she says things to me that she never means to go further-but she said the other day that she preferred the Red 'Ouse to Windsor! And for comfort and cheerfulness so she may!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21530",NA,"""I suppose it is very beautiful then!"" observed Harriet.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21531",NA,"""You must judge for yourself,"" replied the Baroness with a broad smile, ""when you come to London. You'll be your own mistress there I suppose, and not so tied as you are here! I call it a shame to keep you dancing attendance on that brat when there's a nurse whose business it is to look after 'er!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21532",NA,"""O! but indeed it is my own wish!"" said the girl as she cuddled the sleeping baby to her bosom and laid her lips in a long kiss upon its little mouth. ""I asked leave to nurse her! She loves me and even Nurse cannot get her off to sleep as I can! And it is so beautiful to have something to love you, Madame Gobelli! In the Convent I felt so cold-so lonely! If ever I took a liking to a girl we were placed in separate rooms! It is what I have longed for-to come out into the world and find someone to be a friend and to love me, only me, and all for myself!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21533",NA,"Madame Gobelli laughed again.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21534",NA,"""Well! You've only got to shew those eyes of yours to get plenty of people to love you and let you love them in return-that is, if the men count in your estimation of what's beautiful!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21535",NA,"Harriet raised her eyes and looked at the woman who addressed her.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21536",NA,"There was the innocence of Ignorance in them as yet, but the slumbering fire in their depths proved of what her nature would be capable when it was given the opportunity to shew itself. Hers was a passionate temperament, yearning to express itself-panting for the love which it had never known-and ready to burst forth like a tree into blossom directly the sun of Desire and Reciprocity shone upon it. The elder woman, who had not been without her little experiences in her day, recognised the feeling at once and thought that she would not give a fig for the virtue of any man who was subjected to its influence.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21537",NA,"""I don't think that you'll confine your attentions to babies long!"" quoth the Baroness, as she encountered that glance.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21538",NA,"""How do you know?"" said her young companion.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21539",NA,"""Ah! it's enough that I do know, my dear! I 'ave ways and means of knowing things that I keep to myself! I 'ave friends about me too who can tell me everything-who can 'elp me, if I choose, to give Life and Fortune to one person and Trouble and Death to another-and woe to them that offend me, that's all!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21540",NA,"But if the Baroness expected to impress Miss Brandt with her hints of terror she was mistaken. Harriet did not seem in the least astonished. She had been brought up by old Pete and the servants on her father's plantation to believe in witches and the evil eye, and ""Obeah""[94] and the whole cult of Devil worship.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21541",NA,"""I know all about that,"" she remarked presently, ""but you can't do me either good or harm. I want nothing from you and I never shall!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21542",NA,"""Don't you be too sure of that!"" replied Madame Gobelli, nodding her head. ""I've brought young women more luck than enough with their lovers before now-yes! and married women into the bargain! If it 'adn't been for me, Lady-there! it nearly slipped out didn't it?-but there's a certain Countess who would never 'ave been a widow and married for the second time to the man of 'er 'eart, if I 'adn't 'elped 'er and she knows it too! By the way, 'ow do you like Miss Leyton?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21543",NA,"""Not at all,"" replied Harriet quickly. ""She is not a bit like Mrs. Pullen-so cold and stiff and disagreeable! She hardly ever speaks to me! Is it true that she's the daughter of a lord, as Madame Lamont says, and is it that makes her so proud?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21544",NA,"""She's the daughter of Lord Walthamstowe, but that's nothing. They've got no money. 'Er people live down in the country, quite in a beggarly manner. A gal with a fortune of 'er own would rank 'eads and 'eads above 'er in Society. There's not much thought of beside money now-a-days, I can tell you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21545",NA,"""Why does she stay with Mrs. Pullen then? Are they any relation to each other?"" demanded Harriet.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21546",NA,"""Relation, no! I expect she's just brought 'er 'ere out of charity, and because she couldn't afford to go to the seaside by 'erself!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21547",NA,"She had been about to announce the projected relationship between the two ladies when a sudden thought struck her. Captain Ralph Pullen was expected to arrive in Heyst in a few days-thus much she had ascertained through the landlady of the Lion d'Or. She knew by repute that he was considered to be one of the handsomest and most conceited men in the Limerick Rangers, a corps which was noted for its good-looking officers. It might be better for the furtherance of her plans against the peace of Miss Leyton's mind, she thought, to keep her engagement to Captain Pullen a secret-at all events no one could say it was her business to make it public. She looked in Harriet Brandt's yearning, passionate eyes, and decided that it would be strange if any impressionable young man could be thrown within their influence without having his fidelity a little shaken, especially if affianced to such a cold, uninteresting ""bit of goods"" as Elinor Leyton. Like the parrot in the story, though she said nothing, she ""thought a deal"" and inwardly rumbled with half-suppressed laughter as she pictured the discomfiture of the latter young lady, if by any chance she should find her fiancé's attentions transferred from herself to the little West Indian.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21548",NA,"""You seem amused, Madame!"" said Harriet presently.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21549",NA,"""I was thinking of you and all the young men who are doomed to be slaughtered by those eyes of yours,"" said the Baroness. ""You'd make mischief enough amongst my friends, I bet, if I 'ad you at the Red 'Ouse!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21550",NA,"Harriet felt flattered and consciously pleased. She had never received a compliment in the Convent-no one had ever hinted that she was pretty and she had had no opportunity of hearing it since.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21551",NA,"""Do you think I am handsome then?"" she enquired with a heightened colour.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21552",NA,"""I think you're a deal worse! I think you're dangerous!"" replied her new friend, ""and I wouldn't trust you with the Baron any further than I could see you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21553",NA,"""O! how can you say so?"" exclaimed the girl, though she was pleased all the same to hear it said.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21554",NA,"""I wouldn't, and that's the truth! Gustave's an awful fellow after the gals. I 'ave to keep a tight old on 'im, I can tell you, and the more you keep out of 'is way, the better I shall be pleased! You'll make a grand match some day if you're only sharp and keep your eyes open.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21555",NA,"""What do you call a grand match?"" asked Harriet, as she let the nurse take the sleeping child from her arms without remonstrance.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21556",NA,"""Why! a Lord or an Honourable at the very least! since you 'ave money of your own. It's money they're all after in these times you know-why! we 'ave dooks and markisses marrying all sorts of gals from Amurrica-gals whose fathers made their money in oil, or medicine, or electricity, or any other dodge, so long as they made it! And why shouldn't you do the same as the Amurrican gals? You have money, I know-and a goodish lot I fancy-"" added the Baroness, with her cunning eyes fixed upon the girl as if to read her thoughts.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21557",NA,"""O! yes!"" replied Harriet, ""Mr. Trawler, my trustee, said it was too much for a young woman to have under her own control, but I don't know anything about the value of money, never having had it to spend before. I am to have fifteen hundred pounds every year. Is that a good deal?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21558",NA,"""Quite enough to settle you in life, my dear!"" exclaimed the Baroness, who immediately thought what a good thing it would be if Miss Brandt could be persuaded to sink her capital in the boot trade, ""and all under your own control too! You are a lucky young woman! I know 'alf a dozen lords-not to say Princes-who would jump at you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21559",NA,"""Princes!"" cried Harriet, unable to believe her ears.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21560",NA,"""Certainly! Not English ones of course, but German, which are quite as good after all, for a Prince is a Prince any day! There's Prince Adalbert of Waxsquiemer, and Prince Harold of Muddlesheim, and Prince Loris of Taxelmein, and ever so many more, and they're in and out of the Red 'Ouse twenty times a day! But don't you be in an 'urry! Don't take the first that offers, Miss Brandt! Pick and choose! Flirt with whom you like and 'ave your fun, but wait and look about you a bit before you decide!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21561",NA,"The prospect was too dazzling! Harriet Brandt's magnificent eyes were opened to their widest extent-her cheeks flushed with expectation-both life and light had flashed into her countenance. Her soul was expanding, her nature was awakening-it shone through every feature-the Baroness had had no idea she was so beautiful! And the hungry, yearning look was more accentuated than before-it seemed as if she were on the alert, watching for something, like a panther awaiting the advent of its prey. It was a look that women would have shrunk from, and men welcomed and eagerly responded to.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21562",NA,"""I should like to go and see you when I go to England-very much!"" she articulated slowly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21563",NA,"""And so you shall, my dear! The Baron and me will be very glad to 'ave you on a visit. And you mustn't let that capital of yours lie idle, you know! If it's in your own 'ands you must make it yield double to what it does now! You consult Gustave! 'E's a regular business man and knows 'ow many beans make five! 'E'll tell you what's best to be done with it-'e'll be a good friend to you, and you can trust 'im with everything!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21564",NA,"""Thank you!"" replied the girl, but she still seemed to be lost in a kind of reverie. Her gaze was fixed-her full crimsom lips were slightly parted-her slender hands kept nervously clasping and unclasping each other.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21565",NA,"""Well, you are 'andsome and no mistake!"" exclaimed the Baroness. ""You remind me a little of the Duchess of Bewlay before she was married! The first wife, I mean-the second is a poor, pale-faced, sandy-'aired creature. ('Ow the Dook can stomach 'er after the other, I can't make out!) The first Duchess's mother was a great flame of my grandfather, the Dook of-however, I mustn't tell you that! It's a State secret, and I might get into trouble at Court! You'd better not say I mentioned it.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21566",NA,"But Harriet Brandt was not in a condition to remember or repeat anything. She was lost in a dream of the possibilities of the Future.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21567",NA,"The bell for déjeuner roused them at last and brought them to their feet. They resembled each other in one particular: they were equally fond of the pleasures of the table.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21568",NA,"The little Baron appeared dutifully to afford his clumsy spouse the benefit of his support in climbing the hillocks of shifting sand which lay between them and the hotel, and Miss Brandt sped swiftly on her way alone.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21569",NA,"""I've been 'aving a talk with that gal Brandt,"" chuckled the Baroness to her husband, ""she's a regular green-'orn and swallows everything you tell 'er. I've been stuffing 'er up that she ought to marry a Prince with 'er looks and money, and she quite believes it. But she ain't bad-looking when she colours up and I expect she's rather a warm customer, and if she takes a fancy to a man 'e won't well know 'ow to get out of it! And if he tries to she'll make the fur fly. Ha! ha! ha!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21570",NA,"""Better leave it alone, better leave it alone!"" said the stolid German, who had had more than one battle to fight already on account of his wife's matchmaking propensities, and considered her quite too clumsy an artificer to engage in so delicate a game.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21571",NA,"- CHAPTER V -","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21572",NA,"There was a marked difference observable in the manner of Harriet Brandt after her conversation with the Baroness. Thitherto she had been shy and somewhat diffident-the seclusion of her conventual life and its religious teachings had cast a veil, as it were, between her and the outer world and she had not known how to behave, nor how much she might venture to do, on being first cast upon it. But Madame Gobelli's revelations concerning her beauty and her prospects had torn the veil aside and placed a talisman in her hands against her secret fear.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21573",NA,"She was beautiful and dangerous-she might become a Princess if she played her cards well-the knowledge changed the whole face of Nature for her. She became assured, confident, and anticipatory. She began to frequent the company of the Baroness and without neglecting her first acquaintances, Mrs. Pullen and her baby, spent more time in the Gobellis' private sitting-room than in the balcony or public salon, a fact for which Margaret did not hesitate to declare herself grateful.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21574",NA,"""I do not know how it is,"" she confided to Elinor Leyton, ""I rather like the girl, and I would not be unkind to her for all the world, but there is something about her that oppresses me. I seem never to have quite lost the sensation she gave me the first evening that she came here. Her company enervates me-I get neuralgia whenever we have been a short time together-and she leaves me in low spirits and more disposed to cry than laugh!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21575",NA,"""And no wonder,"" said her friend, ""considering that she has that detestable school-girl habit of hanging upon one's arm and dragging one down almost to the earth! How you have stood it so long beats me! Such a delicate woman as you are too. It proves how selfish Miss Brandt must be, not to have seen that she was distressing you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21576",NA,"""Well! it will take a large amount of expended force to drag Madame Gobelli to the ground,"" said Margaret, laughing, ""so I hope Miss Brandt will direct that portion of her attention to her and leave me only the residue. Poor girl! she seems to have had so few people to love, or to love her during her lifetime, that she is glad to practise on anyone who will reciprocate her affection. Did you see the Baroness kissing her this morning?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21577",NA,"""I saw the Baroness scrubbing her beard against Miss Brandt's cheek, if you call that 'kissing'?"" replied Elinor. ""The Baroness never kisses! I have noticed her salute poor Bobby in the morning exactly in the same manner. I have a curiosity to know if it hurts.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21578",NA,"""Why don't you try it?"" said Margaret.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21579",NA,"""No, thank you! I am not so curious as all that! But the Gobellis and Miss Brandt have evidently struck up a great friendship. She will be the recipient of the Baroness's cast-off trinkets and laces next!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21580",NA,"""She is too well off for that, Elinor! Madame Lamont told me she has a fortune in her own right of fifteen hundred a year!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21581",NA,"""She will want it all to gild herself with!"" said Elinor.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21582",NA,"Margaret Pullen looked at Miss Leyton thoughtfully. Did she really mean what she said, or did her jealousy of the West Indian heiress render her capable of uttering untruths? Surely she must see that Harriet Brandt was handsome-growing handsomer indeed every day, with the pure sea air tinting her cheeks with a delicate flush like the inside of a shell-and that her beauty, joined to her money, would render her a tempting morsel for the men and a formidable rival for the women.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21583",NA,"""I do not think you would find many people to agree with your opinion, Elinor!"" she said after a pause, in answer to Miss Leyton's last remark.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21584",NA,"""Well! I think she's altogether odious,"" replied her friend with a toss of her head. ""I thought it the first time I saw her and I shall think it to the last!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21585",NA,"It was the day that Captain Ralph Pullen was expected to arrive in Heyst and the two ladies were preparing to go to the station to meet him.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21586",NA,"""The Baroness has at all events done you one good turn,"" continued Miss Leyton, ""she has delivered you for a few hours from your 'Old Man of the Sea.' What have you been doing with yourself all the morning! I expected you to meet me on the sands, after I had done bathing!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21587",NA,"""I have not stirred out, Elinor. I am uneasy about baby! She does not seem at all well. I have been waiting your return to ask you whether I had not better send for a doctor to see her. But I am not sure if there is such a thing in Heyst!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21588",NA,"""Sure to be, but don't send unless it is absolutely necessary. What is the matter with her?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21589",NA,"The nurse was sitting by the open window with little Ethel on her lap. The infant looked much the same as usual-a little paler perhaps, but in a sound sleep and apparently enjoying it.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21590",NA,"""She does not seem ill to me,"" continued Elinor, ""is she in any pain?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21591",NA,"""Not at all, Miss,"" said the nurse, ""and begging the mistress's pardon, I am sure she is frightening herself without cause. Baby is cutting two more teeth and she feels the heat. That's all!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21592",NA,"""Why are you frightened, Margaret?"" asked Miss Leyton.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21593",NA,"""Because her sleep is unnatural, I am sure of it,"" replied Mrs. Pullen. ""She slept all yesterday and has hardly opened her eyes today. It is more like torpor than sleep. We can hardly rouse her to take her bottle and you know what a lively, restless little creature she has always been.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21594",NA,"""But her teeth,"" argued Elinor Leyton, ""surely her teeth account for everything! I know my sister, Lady Armisdale, says that nothing varies so quickly as teething children-that they're at the point of death one hour and quite well the next, and she has five so she ought to know!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21595",NA,"""That's quite right, Miss,"" interposed the nurse respectfully, ""and you can hardly expect the dear child to be lively when she's in pain. She has a little fever on her too! If she were awake she would only be fretful! I am sure that the best medicine for her is sleep!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21596",NA,"""You hear what Nurse says, Margaret, but if you are nervous why not send for a doctor to see her! We can ask Madame Lamont as we go down stairs who is the best here and call on him as we go to the station, or we can telegraph to Bruges for one if you think it would be better!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21597",NA,"""O! no! no! I will not be foolish! I will try and believe that you and Nurse know better than myself. I will wait at all events until to-morrow.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21598",NA,"""Where has baby been this morning?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21599",NA,"""She was with Miss Brandt on the sands, Miss!"" replied the nurse.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21600",NA,"""Since you are so anxious about Ethel, Margaret, I really wonder that you should trust her with a stranger like Miss Brandt! Perhaps she let the sun beat on her head.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21601",NA,"""O! no, Elinor, Nurse was with them all the time. I would not let Miss Brandt or anyone take baby away alone. But she is so good-natured and so anxious to have her that I don't quite know how to refuse.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21602",NA,"""Perhaps she has been stuffing the child with some of her horrid chocolates or caramels. She is gorging them all day long herself!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21603",NA,"""I know my duty too well for that, Miss!"" said the nurse resentfully. ""I wouldn't have allowed it! The dear baby did not have anything to eat at all.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21604",NA,"""Well! you're both on her side evidently, so I will say no more,"" concluded Miss Leyton. ""At the same time if I had a child I'd sooner trust it to a wild beast than the tender mercies of Miss Brandt. But it's past four o'clock, Margaret! If we are to reach the entrept in time we must be going!"" [95]","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21605",NA,"Mrs. Pullen hastily assumed her hat and mantle, and prepared to accompany her friend. They had opened the door and were about to leave the room when a flood of melody suddenly poured into the apartment. It proceeded from a room at the other end of the corridor and was produced by a mandoline most skilfully played. The silvery notes in rills and trills and chords, such as might have been evolved from a fairy harp, arrested the attention of both Miss Leyton and Mrs. Pullen. They had scarcely expressed their wonder and admiration to each other at the skilful manipulation of the instrument (which evinced such art as they had never heard before except in public) when the strings of the mandoline were accompanied by a young, fresh contralto voice.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21606",NA,"""O! hush! hush!"" cried Elinor, with her finger on her lip, as the rich mellow strains floated through the corridor. ""I don't think I ever heard such a lovely voice before. Whose on earth can it be?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21607",NA,"The words of the song were in Spanish, and the only one they could recognise was the refrain of ""Seralie! Seralie!"" But the melody was wild, pathetic, and passionate, and the singer's voice was touching beyond description.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21608",NA,"""Some professional must have arrived at the Hotel,"" said Margaret. ""I am sure that is not the singing of an amateur. But I hope she will not practise at night and keep baby awake!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21609",NA,"Elinor laughed.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21610",NA,"""O! you mother!"" she said, ""I thought you were lamenting just now that your ewe lamb slept too much! For my part I should like to be lulled to sleep each night by just such strains as those. Listen, Margaret! She has commenced another song. Ah! Gounod's[96] delicious 'Ave Maria'. How beautiful!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21611",NA,"""I don't profess to know much about music"" said Margaret, ""but it strikes me that the charm of that singing lies more in the voice than the actual delivery. Whoever it is must be very young!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21612",NA,"""Whoever it proceeds from it is charming,"" repeated Elinor. ""How Ralph would revel in it! Nothing affects him like music. It is the only thing which makes me regret my inability to play or sing. But I am most curious to learn who the new arrival is. Ah! here is Mademoiselle Brimont!"" she continued, as she caught sight of Olga Brimont slowly mounting the steep staircase, ""Mademoiselle, do you happen to know who it is who owns that lovely voice? Mrs. Pullen and I are perfectly enchanted with it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21613",NA,"Olga Brimont coloured a little. She had never got over her shyness of the English ladies, particularly of the one who spoke so sharply. But she answered at once,","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21614",NA,"""It is Harriet Brandt! Didn't you know that she sung?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21615",NA,"Miss Leyton took a step backward. Her face expressed the intensest surprise-not to say incredulity.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21616",NA,"""Harriet Brandt! Impossible!"" she ejaculated.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21617",NA,"""Indeed it is her,"" repeated Olga. ""She always sung the solos in the Convent choir. They used to say she had the finest voice in the Island. O! yes, it is Harriet, really.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21618",NA,"And she passed on to her own apartment.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21619",NA,"""Do you believe it?"" said Elinor Leyton, turning almost fiercely upon Mrs. Pullen.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21620",NA,"""How can I do otherwise,"" replied Margaret, ""in the face of Mademoiselle Brimont's assertion? But it is strange that we have heard nothing of Miss Brandt's talent before!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21621",NA,"""Has she ever mentioned the fact to you that she could sing?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21622",NA,"""Never! But there has been no opportunity. There is no instrument here and we have never talked of such a thing! Only fancy her possessing so magnificent a voice! What a gift! She might make her fortune by it if she needed to do so.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21623",NA,"""Well! she ought to be able to sing with that mouth of hers,"" remarked Miss Leyton almost bitterly as she walked into the corridor. She was unwilling to accord Harriet Brandt the possession of a single good attribute. As the ladies traversed the corridor they perceived that others had been attracted by the singing as well as themselves and most of the bedroom doors were open. Mrs. Montague caught Margaret by the sleeve as she passed.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21624",NA,"""O! Mrs. Pullen, what a heavenly voice! Whose is it? Fred is just mad to know!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21625",NA,"""It's only that girl Brandt!"" replied Elinor roughly, as she tried to escape further questioning.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21626",NA,"""Miss Brandt! what, the little West Indian! Mrs. Pullen, is Miss Leyton jesting?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21627",NA,"""No, indeed, Mrs. Montague! Mademoiselle Brimont was our inform-ant,"" said Margaret.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21628",NA,"But at that moment their attention was diverted by the appearance of Harriet Brandt herself. She looked brilliant. In one hand she carried her mandoline, a lovely little instrument of sandalwood inlaid with mother-o'-pearl,-her face was flushed with the exertion she had gone through and her abundant hair was somewhat in disorder. Mrs. Montague pounced on her at once.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21629",NA,"""O! Miss Brandt! you are a sly puss! We have all been delighted- enchanted! What do you mean by hiding your light under a bushel in this way? Do come in here for a minute and sing us another song! Major Montague is in ecstasies over your voice!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21630",NA,"""I can't stop, I can't indeed!"" replied Miss Brandt, evidently pleased with the effect she had produced, ""because I am on my way down to dear Madame Gobelli. I promised to sing for her this afternoon. I was only trying my voice to see if it was fit for anything!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21631",NA,"She smiled at Mrs. Pullen as she spoke and added, ""I hope I have not disturbed the darling baby! I thought she would be out this lovely afternoon!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21632",NA,"""O! no! you did not disturb her. We have all been much pleased and surprised to think that you have never told us that you could sing!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21633",NA,"""How could I tell that anyone would care about it?"" replied Harriet indifferently, with a shrug of her shoulders. ""But the Baron is very musical! He has a charming tenor voice. I have promised to accompany him! I mustn't delay any longer! Good afternoon!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21634",NA,"And she flew down the stairs with her mandoline.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21635",NA,"""It is all the dear Baroness and the dear Baron now, you perceive,"" remarked Elinor to Mrs. Pullen as they walked together to the railway station, ""you and the baby are at a discount. Miss Brandt is the sort of young lady, I fancy, who will follow her own interests wherever they may lead her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21636",NA,"""You should be the last to complain of her for that, Elinor, since you have tried to get rid of her at any cost,"" replied her friend.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21637",NA,"Captain Ralph Pullen arrived punctually by the train which he had appointed and greeted his sister-in-law and fiancée with marked cordiality.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21638",NA,"He was certainly a man to be proud of as far as outward appearance went. He was acknowledged, by general consent, to be one of the handsomest men in the British Army and he was fully aware of the fact. He was tall and well built with good features, almost golden hair; womanish blue eyes, and a long drooping moustache which he was always caressing with his left hand. He regarded all women with the same languishing, tired-to-death glance, as if the attentions shewn him by the beau sexe had been altogether too much for him and the most he could do now was to regard them with an indolent, worn-out favour which had had all the excitement and freshness and flavour taken out of it long before. Most women would have considered his method of treatment as savouring little short of insult but Elinor Leyton's nature did not make extravagant demands upon her lover, and so long as he dressed and looked well and paid her the courtesies due from a gentleman to a gentlewoman, she was quite satisfied. Margaret, on the other hand, had seen through her brother-in-law's affectations from the first and despised him for them. She thought him foolish, vain, and uncompanionable, but she bore with him for Arthur's sake. She would have welcomed his cousin Anthony Pennell, though, with twice the fervour.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21639",NA,"Ralph was looking remarkably well. His light grey suit of tweed was fresh and youthful looking and the yellow rose in his buttonhole was as dainty as if he had just walked out of his Piccadilly club.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21640",NA,"He was quite animated (for him) at the idea of spending a short time in Heyst and actually went the length of informing Elinor that she looked ""very fit"" and if it was not so public a place he should kiss her. Miss Leyton coloured faintly at the remark but she turned her head away and would not let him see that she was sorry the place was so public.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21641",NA,"""Heyst seems to have done you both a lot of good,"" Captain Pullen went on presently. ""I am sure you are fatter, Margaret, than when you were in Town. And how is the daughter?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21642",NA,"""Not very well, I am sorry to say, Ralph! She is cutting more teeth. Elinor and I were consulting whether we should send for a doctor to see her only this afternoon.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21643",NA,"""By the way, I have good news for you, or you will consider it so. Old Phillips is coming over to join us next week.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21644",NA,"""Doctor Phillips, my dear old godfather!"" exclaimed Margaret, ""O! I am glad to hear it! He will set baby to rights at once. But who told you so, Ralph?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21645",NA,"""The old gentleman himself! I met him coming out of his club the other day and told him I was coming over here and he said he should follow suit as soon as ever he could get away, and I was to tell you to get a room for him by next Monday!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21646",NA,"""I shall feel quite happy about my baby now,"" said Mrs. Pullen. ""I have not much faith in Belgian doctors. Their pharmacopœia is quite different from ours, but Doctor Phillips will see if there is anything wrong with her at once!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21647",NA,"""I hope you will not be disappointed with the Hotel visitors, Ralph,"" said Elinor, ""but they are a terrible set of riffraff. It is impossible to make friends with any one of them. They are such dreadful people!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21648",NA,"""O! you mustn't class them all together, Elinor,"" interposed Margaret. ""I am sure the Montagues and the Vieuxtemps are nice enough! And du reste, there is no occasion for Ralph even to speak to them.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21649",NA,"""Of course not,"" said Captain Pullen. ""I have come over for the sake of your company and Margaret's and have no intention of making the acquaintance of any strangers. When is the Bataille des Fleurs? Next week! that's jolly. Old Phillips will be here by that time, and he and Margaret can flirt together whilst you and I are billing and cooing, eh Elinor?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21650",NA,"""Don't be vulgar, Ralph,"" she answered, ""you know how I dislike that sort of thing! And we have had so much of it here!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21651",NA,"""What, billing and cooing?"" he questioned. But Elinor disdained to make any further remark on the subject.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21652",NA,"The appearance of Ralph Pullen at the table d'hte dinner naturally excited a good deal of speculation. The English knew that Mrs. Pullen expected her brother-in-law to stay with her but the foreigners were all curious to ascertain who the handsome, well-groomed, military looking stranger might be, who was so familiar with Mrs. Pullen and her friend. The Baroness was not behind the rest in curiosity and admiration. She was much before them in her determination to gratify her curiosity and make the acquaintance of the newcomer whose name she guessed, though no introduction had passed between them. She waited through two courses to see if Margaret Pullen would take the initiative but finding that she addressed all her conversation to Captain Pullen, keeping her face, meanwhile, pertinaciously turned from the party sitting opposite to her, she determined to force her hand.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21653",NA,"""Mrs. Pullen!"" she cried, in her coarse voice, ""when are you going to introduce me to your 'andsome friend?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21654",NA,"Margaret coloured uneasily and murmured,","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21655",NA,"""My brother-in-law, Captain Pullen-Madame Gobelli.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21656",NA,"""Very glad to see you, Captain,"" said the Baroness, as Ralph bowed to her in his most approved fashion, ""your sister thought she'd keep you all to 'erself, I suppose! But the young ladies of Heyst would soon make mincemeat of Mrs. Pullen if she tried that little game on them. We 'aven't got too many good-looking young men 'ereabouts, I can tell you. Are you going to stay long?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21657",NA,"Captain Pullen murmured something about ""uncertain"" and ""not being quite sure,"" whilst the Baroness regarded him full in the face with a broad smile on her own. She always had a keen eye for a handsome young man!","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21658",NA,"""Ah! you'll stay as long as it suits your purpose, won't you? I expect you 'ave your own little game to play, same as most of us! And it's a pretty little game too, isn't it, especially when a fellow's young and goodlooking and 'as the chink-a-chink, eh?","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21659",NA,"""I fancy I know some of your brother officers, Mr. Naggett and Lord Menzies. They belong to the Rangers don't they?"" continued Madame Gobelli, ""Prince Adalbert of Waxsquiemer used to bring 'em to the Red 'Ouse! By the way I 'aven't introduced you to my 'usband, Baron Gobelli! Gustave, this is Captain Ralph Pullen, the Colonel's brother you know. You must 'ave a talk with 'im after dinner! You two would 'it it off first-rate together! Gustave's in the boot trade you know, Captain Pullen! We trade under the name of Fantaisie et Cie! The best boots and shoes in London and the largest manufactory, I give you my word! You should get your boots from us. I know you dandy officers are awfully particular about your tootsies. If you'll come and see me in London I'll take you over the manufactory and give you a pair. You'll never buy any others once you've tried 'em!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21660",NA,"Ralph Pullen bowed again and said he felt certain that Madame was right and he looked forward to the fulfilment of her promise with the keenest anticipation.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21661",NA,"Harriet Brandt meanwhile, sitting almost opposite to the stranger, was regarding him from under the thick lashes of her slumbrous eyes like a lynx watching its prey. She had never seen so good-looking and aristo-cratic a young man before. His crisp golden hair and drooping moustaches, his fair complexion, blue eyes and chiselled features were a revelation to her. Would the Princes whom Madame Gobelli had promised she should meet at her house be anything like him she wondered-could they be as handsome, as perfectly dressed, as fashion-able, as completely at their ease as the man before her? Every other moment she was stealing a veiled glance at him-and Captain Pullen was quite aware of the fact. What young man, or woman is not aware when they are being furtively admired? Ralph Pullen was one of the most conceited of his sex, which is not saying a little-he was accablé[97] with female attentions wherever he went, yet he was not blasé with them so long as he was not called upon to reciprocate in kind. Each time that Harriet's magnetic gaze sought his face, his eyes, by some mystical chance, were lifted to meet it and though all four lids were modestly dropped again, their owners did not forget the effect their encounter had left behind it.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21662",NA,"""'Ave you been round Heyst yet, Captain Pullen,"" vociferated Madame Gobelli, ""and met the Procession? I never saw such rubbish in my life. I laughed fit to burst myself! A lot of children rigged out in blue and white, carrying a doll on a stick, and a crowd of fools following and singing 'ymns. Call that Religion? It's all tommy rot. Don't you agree with me, Mrs. Pullen?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21663",NA,"""I cannot say that I do, Madame! I have been taught to respect every religion that is followed with sincerity, whether I agree with its doctrine or not. Besides, I thought the procession you allude to a very pretty sight. Some of the children with their fair hair and wreaths of flowers looked like little angels!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21664",NA,"""O! you're an 'umbug!"" exclaimed the Baroness, ""you say that just to please these Papists. Not that I wouldn't just as soon be a Papist as a Protestant, but I 'ate cant. I wouldn't 'ave Bobby 'ere, brought up in any religion. Let 'im choose for 'imself when 'e's a man, I said, but no cant, no 'umbug! I 'ad a governess for 'im once, a dirty little sneak, who thought she'd get the better of me, so she made the boy kneel down each night and say, 'God bless father and mother and all kind friends, and God bless my enemies.' I came on 'em one evening and I 'ad 'im up on his legs in a moment. I won't 'ave it, Bobby, I said, I won't 'ave you telling lies for anyone, and I made 'im repeat after me, 'God bless father and mother and all kind friends, and d-n my enemies.' The governess was so angry with me that she gave warning, he! he! he! But I 'ad my way, and Bobby 'asn't said a prayer since, 'ave you, Bobby?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21665",NA,"""Sometimes, Mamma!"" replied the lad in a low voice. Margaret Pullen's kind eyes sought his at once with an encouraging smile.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21666",NA,"""Well! you'd better not let me 'ear you, or I'll give you 'what for.' I 'ate 'umbug, don't you, Captain Pullen?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21667",NA,"""Unreservedly, Madame!"" replied Ralph in a stifled voice and with an inflamed countenance. He had been trying to conceal his amusement for some time past, greatly to the disgust of Miss Leyton who would have had him pass by his opposite neighbour's remarks in silent contempt, and the effort had been rather trying. As he spoke his eyes sought those of Harriet Brandt again and discovered the sympathy with his distress lurking in them, coupled with a very evident look of admiration for himself. He looked at her back again-only one look, but it spoke volumes! Captain Pullen had never given such a glance at his fiancée, nor received one from her! It is problematical if Elinor Leyton could make a telegraph of her calm brown eyes-if her soul (if indeed she had in that sense a soul at all) ever pierced the bounds of its dwelling-place to look through its windows. As the dessert appeared, Margaret whispered to her brother-in-law, ""If we do not make our escape now we may not get rid of her all the evening,"" at which hint he rose from table, and the trio left the salle à manger together. As Margaret descended again, equipped for their evening stroll, she perceived Harriet Brandt in the corridor also ready and waiting apparently for her. She took her aside at once.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21668",NA,"""I cannot ask you to join us in our walk this evening, Miss Brandt,"" she said, ""because, as it is the first day of my brother's arrival, we shall naturally have many family topics to discuss together!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21669",NA,"For the first time since their acquaintance she observed a sullen look creep over Harriet Brandt's features.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21670",NA,"""I am going to walk with the Baron and Baroness, thank you all the same!"" she replied to Margaret's remark, and turning on her heel she re-entered her room. Margaret did not believe her statement but she was glad she had had the courage to warn her-she knew it would have greatly annoyed Elinor if the girl she detested had accompanied them on that first evening. The walk proved after all to be a very ordinary one. They paraded up and down the Digue until they were tired and then they sat down on green chairs and listened to the orchestra whilst Ralph smoked his cigarettes. Elinor was looking her best. She was pleased and mildly excited-her costume became her-and she was presumably enjoying herself, but as far as her joy in Captain Pullen went she might have been walking with her father or her brother. The conscious looks that had passed between him and Harriet Brandt were utterly wanting.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21671",NA,"They began by talking of home, of Elinor's family, and the last news that Margaret had received from Arthur-and then went on to discuss the visitors to the Hotel. Miss Leyton waxed loud in her denunciation of the Baroness and her familiar vulgarity-she deplored the ill fate that had placed them in such close proximity at the table d'hte, and hoped that Ralph would not hesitate to change his seat if the annoyance became too great. She had warned him, she said, of what he might expect by joining them at Heyst.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21672",NA,"""My dear girl,"" he replied, ""pray don't distress yourself! In the first place I know a great deal more about foreign hotels than you do and knew exactly what I might expect to encounter, and in the second, I don't mind it in the least-in fact I like it, it amuses me. I think the Baroness is quite a character, and look forward to cultivating her acquaintance with the keenest anticipations.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21673",NA,"""O! don't, Ralph, pray don't!"" exclaimed Miss Leyton fastidiously, ""the woman is beneath contempt! I should be exceedingly annoyed if you permitted her to get at all intimate with you.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21674",NA,"""Why not, if it amuses him?"" demanded Margaret laughing, ""for my part I agree with Ralph that her very vulgarity makes her most amusing as a change, and it is not as if we were likely to be thrown in her way when we return to England!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21675",NA,"""She is a rara avis,""[98] cried Captain Pullen enthusiastically. ""She certainly must know some good people if men like Naggett and Menzies have been at her house, and yet the way she advertises her boots and shoes is too delicious! O! dear yes! I cannot consent to cut the Baroness Gobelli! I am half in love with her already!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21676",NA,"Elinor Leyton made a gesture of disgust.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21677",NA,"""And you-who are considered to be one of the most select and fastidious men in Town,"" she said, ""I wonder at you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21678",NA,"Then he made a bad matter worse by saying,","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21679",NA,"""By the way, Margaret, who was that beautiful girl who sat on the opposite side of the table?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21680",NA,"""The what,"" exclaimed Elinor Leyton, ungrammatically, as she turned round upon the Digue and confronted him.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21681",NA,"""He means Miss Brandt!"" interposed Margaret hastily, ""many people think that she is handsome!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21682",NA,"""No one could think otherwise,"" responded Ralph. ""Is she Spanish?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21683",NA,"""O! no; her parents were English. She comes from Jamaica!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21684",NA,"""Ah! a drop of Creole blood in her then, I daresay! You never see such eyes in an English face!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21685",NA,"""What's the matter with her eyes?"" asked Elinor sharply.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21686",NA,"""They're very large and dark, you know, Elinor!"" said Mrs. Pullen, observing the cloud which was settling down upon the girl's face, ""but it is not everybody who admires dark eyes, or you and I would come off badly!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21687",NA,"""Well, with all due deference to you, my fair sister-in-law,"" replied Ralph with the stupidity of a selfish man who never knows when he is wounding his hearers, ""most people give the preference to dark eyes in women. Anyway, Miss Brandt (if that is her name), is a beauty and no mistake!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21688",NA,"""I can't say that I admire your taste,"" said Elinor, ""and I sincerely hope that Miss Brandt will not force her company upon us whilst you are here. Margaret and I have suffered more than enough already in that respect! She is only half educated and knows nothing of the world, and is altogether a most uninteresting companion. I dislike her exceedingly!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21689",NA,"""Ah! don't forget her singing!"" cried Margaret, unwittingly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21690",NA,"""Does she sing?"" demanded the Captain.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21691",NA,"""Yes! and wonderfully well for an amateur! She plays the mandoline also. I think Elinor is a little hard on her! Of course she is very young and unformed, but she has only just come out of a convent where she has been educated for the last ten years. What can you expect of a girl who has never been out in Society? I know that she is very good-natured and has waited on baby as if she had been her servant!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21692",NA,"""Don't you think we have had about enough of Miss Harriet Brandt?"" said Elinor, ""I want to hear what Ralph thinks of Heyst, or if he advises our going on to Ostende. I believe Ostende is much gayer and brighter than Heyst!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21693",NA,"""But we must wait now till Doctor Phillips joins us,"" interposed Margaret.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21694",NA,"""He could come after us, if Ralph preferred Ostende or Blanken-burghe,"" said Elinor eagerly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21695",NA,"""My dear ladies,"" exclaimed Captain Pullen, ""allow me to form an opinion of Heyst first and then we will talk about other places. This seems pleasant enough in all conscience to me now!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21696",NA,"""O! you two are bound to think any place pleasant,"" laughed Margaret, ""but I think I must go in to my baby! I do not feel easy to be away from her too long now that she is ailing. But there is no need for you to come in, Elinor! It is only just nine o'clock!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21697",NA,"""I would rather accompany you,"" replied Miss Leyton, primly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21698",NA,"""No! no! Elinor, stay with me! If you are tired we can sit in the balcony. I have seen nothing of you yet!"" remonstrated her lover.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21699",NA,"She consented to sit in the balcony with him for a few minutes, but she would not permit his chair to be placed too close to hers.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21700",NA,"""The waiters pass backward and forward,"" she said, ""and what would they think?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21701",NA,"""The deuce take what they think,"" replied Captain Pullen, ""I haven't seen you for two months and you keep me at arm's length as if I should poison you! What do you suppose a man is made of?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21702",NA,"""My dear Ralph, you know it is nothing of the kind, but it is quite impossible that we can sit side by side like a pair of turtle doves in a public Hotel like this!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21703",NA,"""Let us go up to your room then?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21704",NA,"""To my bedroom?"" she ejaculated with horror.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21705",NA,"""To Margaret's room then! she won't be so prudish, I'm sure! Anywhere where I can speak to you alone!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21706",NA,"""The nurse will be in Margaret's room with little Ethel!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21707",NA,"""Hang it all, then, come for another walk! Let us go away from the town, out on those sand hills. I'm sure no one will see us there!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21708",NA,"""Dear Ralph, you must be reasonable! If I were seen walking about Heyst alone with you at night it would be all over the town to-morrow.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21709",NA,"""Let it be! Where's the harm?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21710",NA,"""But I have kept our engagement most scrupulously secret! No one knows anything but that you are Margaret's brother-in-law! You don't know how they gossip and chatter in a place like this. I could never consent to appear at the public table d'hte again if I thought that all those vulgarians had been discussing my most private affairs!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21711",NA,"""O! well! just as you choose!"" replied Ralph Pullen discontentedly, ""but I suppose you will not object to my taking another turn along the Digue before I go to bed! Here, garçon, bring me a chasse! Good-night then, if you will not stay!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21712",NA,"""It is not that I will not-it is that I cannot, Ralph!"" said Miss Leyton, as she gave him her hand. ""Good-night! I hope you will find your room comfortable, and if it is fine to-morrow we will have a nice walk in whichever direction you prefer!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21713",NA,"""And much good that will be!"" grumbled the young man as he lighted his cigarette and strolled out again upon the Digue.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21714",NA,"As he stood for a moment looking out upon the sea which was one mass of silvery ripples, he heard himself called by name. He looked up. The Gobellis had a private sitting-room facing the Digue on the ground floor and the Baroness was leaning out of the open window and beckoning to him.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21715",NA,"""Won't you come in and 'ave a whiskey and soda?"" she asked. ""The Baron 'as 'is own whiskey 'ere, real Scotch, none of your nasty Belgian stuff, 'alf spirits of wine and 'alf varnish! Come along! We've got a jolly little parlour and my little friend 'Arriet Brandt shall sing to you! Unless you're off on some lark of your own, eh?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21716",NA,"""No! indeed,"" replied Ralph, ""I was only wondering what I should do with myself for the next hour. Thank you so much! I'll come with pleasure.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21717",NA,"And in another minute he was seated in the company of the Baron and Baroness and Harriet Brandt.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21718",NA,"- CHAPTER VI -","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21719",NA,"The day had heralded in the Bataille des Fleurs and all Heyst was en fête. The little furnished villas, hired for the season, were all built alike with a balcony on the ground floor which was transformed into a veritable bower for the occasion. Villa Imperatrice vied with Villa Mentone and Villa Sebastien as to which decoration should be the most beautiful and effective, and the result was a long line of arbours garlanded with every sort of blossom. From early morning the occupants were busy entwining their pillars with evergreens interspersed with flags and knots of ribbon, whilst the balustrades were laden with growing flowers and the tables inside bore vases of severed blooms. One balcony was decorated with corn, poppies and bluets, whilst the next would display pink roses mixed with the delicate blue of the sea-nettle, and the third would be all yellow silk and white marguerites. The procession of charettes and the Bataille itself was not to commence till the afternoon, so the visitors crowded the sands as usual in the morning, leaving the temporary owners of the various villas to toil for their gratification during their absence. Margaret Pullen felt sad as she sat in the hotel balcony watching the proceedings on each side of her. She had intended her baby's peram-bulator to take part in the procession of charettes and had ordered a quantity of white field lilies with which to decorate it. It was to be a veritable triumph-so she and Miss Leyton had decided between themselves-and she had fondly pictured how lovely little Ethel would look with her fluffy yellow hair lying amongst the blossoms, but now baby was too languid and ill to be taken out of doors and Margaret had given all the flowers to the little Montagues who were trimming their mail-cart with them in their own fashion. As she sat there, with a pensive, thoughtful look upon her face, Harriet Brandt, dressed in a costume of grass-cloth with a broad-brimmed hat, nodding with poppies and green leaves that wonderfully became her, on her head, entered the balcony with an eager, excited appearance.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21720",NA,"""O! Mrs. Pullen! have you seen the Baroness?"" she exclaimed.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21721",NA,"""We are going to bathe this morning. Aren't you coming down to the sands?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21722",NA,"""No! Miss Brandt, not to-day. I am unhappy about my dear baby! I am sure you will be sorry to hear that she has been quite ill all night-so restless and feverish!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21723",NA,"""O! she'll be all right directly her teeth come through!"" replied Harriet indifferently, as her eyes scanned the scene before them. ""There's the Baroness! She's beckoning to me! Good-bye!"" and without a word of sympathy or comfort, she rushed away to join her friends.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21724",NA,"""Like the way of the world!"" thought Margaret, as she watched the girl skimming over the sands, ""but somehow-I didn't think she would be so heartless!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21725",NA,"Miss Leyton and her fiancé had strolled off after breakfast to take a walk and Mrs. Pullen went back to her own room, and sat down quietly to needlework. She was becoming very anxious for Doctor Phillips' arrival; had even written to England to ask him to hurry it if possible-for her infant, though not positively ill, rejected her food so often that she was palpably thinner and weaker.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21726",NA,"After she had sat there for some time she took up her fieldglasses to survey the bathers on the beach. She had often done so before, when confined to the hotel-it afforded her amusement to watch their faces and antics. On the present occasion she had no difficulty in distinguishing the form of the Baroness Gobelli looking enormous as, clad in a most conspicuous bathing costume, she waddled from her machine into the water, loudly calling attention to her appearance from all assembled on the sands as she went. The Baron, looking little less comical, advanced to conduct his spouse down to the water, whilst after them flew a slight boyish figure in yellow with a mane of dark hair hanging down her back, which Margaret immediately recognised as that of Harriet Brandt.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21727",NA,"She was dancing about in the shallow water, shrieking whenever she made a false step and clinging hold of the Baron's hand, when Margaret saw another gentleman come up to them and join in the ring. She turned the glasses upon him and saw to her amazement that it was her brother-in-law. Her first feeling was that of annoyance. There was nothing extraordinary or improper in his joining the Baroness's party-men and women bathed promiscuously in Heyst, and no one thought anything of it. But that Ralph should voluntarily mix himself up with the Gobellis, after Elinor's particular request that he should keep aloof from them, was a much more serious matter. And by the way, that reminded her, where was Elinor the while? Margaret could not discern her anywhere upon the sands and wondered if she had also been persuaded to bathe. She watched Captain Pullen evidently trying to induce Miss Brandt to venture further into the water, holding out both hands for her protection-she also saw her yield to his persuasion and leaving go of her hold on the Herr Baron, trust herself entirely to the stranger's care. Mrs. Pullen turned from the window with a sigh. She hoped there were not going to be any ""ructions"" between Ralph and Elinor-but she would not have liked her to see him at that moment. She bestowed a silent benediction, ""not loud, but deep""[99] on the foreign fashion of promiscuous bathing, and walked across the corridor to her friend's room to see if she had returned to the Hotel. To her surprise she found Miss Leyton dismantled of her walking attire, soberly seated at her table writing letters.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21728",NA,"""Why! Elinor,"" she said, ""I thought you were out with Ralph!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21729",NA,"The young lady was quite composed.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21730",NA,"""So I was,"" she answered, ""until half an hour ago! But as he then expressed his determination to bathe I left him to his own devices and came back to write my letters.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21731",NA,"""Would he not have preferred your waiting on the sands till he could join you again?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21732",NA,"""I did not ask him! I should think he would hardly care for me to watch him whilst bathing, and I am sure I should not consent to do so!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21733",NA,"""But everybody does it here, Elinor, and if you did not care to go down to the beach you might have waited for him on the Digue.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21734",NA,"""My dear Margaret, I am not in the habit of dancing attendance upon men. It is their business to come after me! If Ralph is eager for another walk after his dip he can easily call for me here!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21735",NA,"""True! and he can as easily go for his walk with any stray acquaintance he may pick up on the sands!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21736",NA,"""O! if he should prefer it, he is welcome to do so,"" replied Elinor, resuming her scribbling.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21737",NA,"""My dear Elinor, I don't think you quite understand Ralph! He has been terribly spoilt you know, and when men have been accustomed to attention they will take it wherever they can get it! He has come over here expressly to be with you, so I think you should give him every minute of your time. Men are fickle creatures, my dear! It will take some time yet to despoil them of the idea that women were made for their convenience.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21738",NA,"""I am afraid the man is not born yet for whose convenience I was made!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21739",NA,"""Well! you know the old saying: 'Most women can catch a man but it takes a clever woman to keep him.' I don't mean to insinuate that you are in any danger of losing Ralph, but I think he's quite worth keeping and, I believe you think so too!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21740",NA,"""And I mean to keep him!"" replied Miss Leyton, as she went on writing.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21741",NA,"Margaret did not venture to give her any further hints but returned to her own room and took another look through her spyglass.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21742",NA,"The bathers in whom she was interested had returned to their machines by this time and presently emerged, ""clothed and in their right minds.""[100] Miss Brandt, looking more attractive than before with her long hair hanging down her back to dry. And then, that occurred which she had been anticipating. Captain Pullen, having taken a survey of the beach and seeing none of his own party there, climbed with Harriet Brandt to where they were high and dry above the tide and threw himself down on the hot, loose sand by her side, whilst the Baron and Baroness with a laughing injunction to the two young people to take care of themselves, toiled up to the Digue and walked off in another direction.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21743",NA,"When they all met at déjeuner, she attacked her brother-in-law on the subject.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21744",NA,"""Have you been bathing all this while?"" she said to him, ""you must have stayed very long in the water!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21745",NA,"""O! dear no!"" he replied, ""I wasn't in above a quarter of an hour!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21746",NA,"""And what have you been doing since?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21747",NA,"""Strolling about looking for you and Elinor!"" said Captain Pullen. Why the dickens didn't you come out this lovely morning?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21748",NA,"""I could not leave baby!"" said Margaret shortly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21749",NA,"""And I was writing,"" chimed in Elinor.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21750",NA,"""Very well, ladies, if you prefer your own company to mine, of course I have nothing to say against it! But I suppose you are not going to shut yourselves up this afternoon!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21751",NA,"""O! no. It is a public duty to attend the Bataille des Fleurs. Have you bought any confetti, Ralph?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21752",NA,"""I have! Miss Brandt was good enough to shew me where to get them and we are well provided. There is to be a race between lady jockeys at the end of the Digue too, I perceive!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21753",NA,"""What, with horses?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21754",NA,"""I conclude so. I see they have railed in a portion of ground for the purpose,"" replied Captain Pullen.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21755",NA,"""'Ow could they race without 'orses?"" called out the Baroness.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21756",NA,"Harriet Brandt did not join in the conversation but she was gazing all the while at Ralph Pullen-not furtively as she had done the day before, but openly and unabashedly, as though she held a proprietary right in him. Margaret noticed her manner at once and interpreted it aright but Miss Leyton, true to her principles, never raised her eyes in her direction and ignored everything that came from that side of the table.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21757",NA,"Mrs. Pullen was annoyed; she knew how angry Elinor would be if she intercepted any telegraphic communication between her lover and Miss Brandt; and she rose from the table as soon as possible in order to avert such a catastrophe. She had never considered her brother-in-law a very warm wooer and she fancied that his manner towards Miss Leyton was more indifferent than usual. She took one turn with them along the Digue to admire the flower-bedecked villas which were in full beauty and then returned to her nursery, glad of an excuse to leave them together and give Elinor a chance of becoming more cordial and affectionate to Ralph than she had yet appeared to be. The lovers had not been alone long, however, before they were waylaid, to the intense disgust of Elinor, by Harriet Brandt and her friend Olga Brimont.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21758",NA,"Still further to her annoyance, Captain Pullen seemed almost to welcome the impertinent interference of the two girls, who could scarcely have had the audacity to join their company unless he had invited them to do so.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21759",NA,"""The charettes are just about to start!"" exclaimed Harriet, ""O! they are lovely, and such dear little children! I am so glad that the Bataille des Fleurs takes place to-day because my friend's brother, Alfred Brimont, is coming to take her to Brussels the day after to-morrow!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21760",NA,"""Brussels is a jolly place. Mademoiselle Brimont will enjoy herself there,"" said Ralph. ""There are theatres and balls and picture-galleries and every pleasure that a young lady's heart can desire!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21761",NA,"""Have you been to Brussels?"" asked Harriet.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21762",NA,"""Yes! when I was a nasty little boy in jacket and trousers. I was placed at Mr. Jackson's English school there in order that I might learn French, but I'm afraid that was the last thing I acquired. The Jackson boys were known all over the town for the greatest nuisances in it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21763",NA,"""What did you do?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21764",NA,"""What did we not do? We tore up and down the rue Montagne de la Cour at all hours of the day, shouting and screaming and getting into scrapes. We ran up bills at the shops which we had no money to pay-we appeared at every place of amusement-and we made love to all the school-girls till we had become a terror to the school-mistresses.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21765",NA,"""What naughty boys!"" remarked Miss Brandt, with a side-glance at Miss Leyton. She did not like to say all she thought before this very stiff and proper young English lady. ""But Captain Pullen,"" she continued, ""where are the confetti? Have you forgotten them? Shall I go and buy some more?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21766",NA,"""No! no! my pockets are stuffed with them,"" he said, producing two bags, of which he handed Harriet one. Her thanks were conveyed by throwing a large handful of tiny pieces of blue and white and pink paper (which do duty for the more dangerous chalk sugarplums) at him and which covered his tweed suit and sprinkled his fair hair and moustaches. He returned the compliment by flying after her retreating figure and liberally showering confetti upon her.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21767",NA,"""O! Ralph! I do hope you are not going to engage in this horseplay,"" exclaimed Elinor Leyton, ""because if so I would rather return to the Hotel. Surely we may leave such vulgarities to the common people and-Miss Harriet Brandt!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21768",NA,"""What nonsense!"" he replied. ""It's evident you've never been in Rome during the Carnival! Why everyone does it! It's the national custom. If you imagine I'm going to stand by, like a British tourist, and stare at everything without joining in the fun, you're very much mistaken!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21769",NA,"""But is it fun?"" questioned Miss Leyton.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21770",NA,"""To me it is! Here goes!"" he cried, as he threw a handful of paper into the face of a passing stranger who gave him as good as she had got in return.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21771",NA,"""I call it low-positively vulgar,"" said Miss Leyton, ""to behave so familiarly with people one has never seen before-of whose antecedents one knows nothing! I should be very much surprised if the mob behaved in such a manner towards me. Oh!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21772",NA,"The exclamation was induced by the action of some young épicier, or hotel garçon, who threw a mass of confetti into her face with such violence as almost for the moment to blind her.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21773",NA,"""Ha! ha! ha!"" roared Ralph Pullen with his healthy British lungs, as he saw her outraged feelings depicted in her countenance.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21774",NA,"""I thought you'd get it before long!"" he said, as she attempted to brush the offending paper off her mantle.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21775",NA,"""It has not altered my opinion of the indecency of the custom!"" she replied.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21776",NA,"""Never mind!"" he returned soothingly. ""Here come the charettes.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21777",NA,"They were really a charming sight. On one cart was drawn a boat, with little children dressed as fishermen and women-another represented a harvest field, with the tiny haymakers and reapers-whilst a third was piled with wool to represent snow, on the top of which were seated three little girls attired as Esquimaux.[101] The mail-carts and perambulators belonging to the visitors to Heyst were also well represented and beautifully trimmed with flowers. The first prize was embowered in lilies and white roses, whilst its tiny inmate was seated in state as the Goddess Flora,[102] with a wreath twined in her golden curls. The second was taken by a gallant Neapolitan fisherman of about four years old, who wheeled a mail-cart of pink roses in which sat his little sisters, dressed as angels with large white wings. The third was a wheel barrow hidden in moss and narcissi, on which reposed a Sleeping Beauty robed in white tissue with a coronal of forget-me-nots.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21778",NA,"Harriet Brandt fell into ecstasies over everything she saw. When pleased and surprised she expressed herself more like a child than a young woman and became extravagant and ungovernable. She tried to kiss each baby that took part in the procession, and thrust coins into their chubby hands to buy bonbons and confetti with. Captain Pullen thought her conduct most natural and unaffected; but Miss Leyton insisted that it was all put on for effect. Olga Brimont tried to put in a good word for her friend.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21779",NA,"""Harriet is very fond of children,"" she said, ""but she has never seen any-there were no children at the Convent under ten years of age, so she does not know how to make enough of them when she meets them. She wants to kiss everyone. Some times, I tell her I think she would like to eat them. But she only means to be kind!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21780",NA,"""I am sure of that!"" said Captain Pullen.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21781",NA,"""But she should be told,"" interposed Elinor, ""that it is not the custom in civilized countries for strangers to kiss every child they meet, any more than it is to speak before being introduced, or to bestow their company where it is not desired. Miss Brandt has a great deal to learn in that respect before she can enter English Society!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21782",NA,"As is often the case when a woman becomes unjust in abusing another, Miss Leyton made Captain Pullen say more to cover her discourtesy than, in other circumstances, he would have done.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21783",NA,"""Miss Brandt,"" he said slowly, ""is so beautiful that she will have a great deal forgiven her, that would not be overlooked in a plainer woman.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21784",NA,"""That may be your opinion, but it is not mine,"" replied Miss Leyton.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21785",NA,"Her tone was so acid that it sent him flying from her side to battle with his confetti against the tribe of Montagues who, fortunately for the peace of all parties, joined their forces to theirs and after some time spent on the Digue they returned, a large party, to the Hotel.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21786",NA,"It was not until they had sat down to dinner that they remembered they had never been to see the lady jockey race.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21787",NA,"""He! he! he!"" laughed Madame Gobelli, ""but I did and you lost something, I can tell you! We 'ad great difficulty to get seats but when we did, it was worth it, wasn't it, Gustave?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21788",NA,"""You said so, mein tear!"" replied the Baron, gravely.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21789",NA,"""And you thought so, you old rascal! don't you tell me! I saw your wicked eyes glozing at the gals in their breeches and boots! There weren't any 'orses after all, Captain Pullen, but sixteen gals with different coloured jackets on and top boots and tight white breeches, such a sight you never saw, Gustave 'ere, did 'ave a treat! As for Bobby, when I found we couldn't get out again because of the crowd, I tied my 'andkerchief over 'is eyes, and made him put 'is 'ead in my lap!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21790",NA,"""Dear! dear!"" cried Ralph, laughing, ""was it as bad as that, Madame?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21791",NA,"""Bad! my dear boy! It was as bad as it could be! It's a mercy you weren't there or we shouldn't 'ave seen you 'ome again so soon! There were the sixteen gals with their tight breeches and their short racing jackets, and a fat fellow dressed like a huntsman whipping 'em round and round the ring as if they were so much cattle! You should 'ave seen them 'op when he touched 'em up with the lash of 'is whip. I expect they've never 'ad such a tingling since the time their mothers smacked 'em! There was a little fat one there! I wish you could 'ave seen 'er, when 'e whipped 'er to make 'er 'urry! It was comical! She 'opped like a kangaroo!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21792",NA,"""And what was the upshot of it all? Who won?"" asked Ralph.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21793",NA,"""O! I don't know! I got Gustave out as soon as I could! I wasn't going to let 'im spend the whole afternoon watching those gals 'opping. There were 'is eyes goggling out of 'is 'ead, and his lips licking each other as if 'e was sucking a sugar-stick-""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21794",NA,"""Mein tear! mein tear!"" interposed the unfortunate Baron.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21795",NA,"""You go on with your dinner, Gustave, and leave me alone! I saw you! And no more lady jockey races do you attend whilst we're in this Popish country. They ain't good for you.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21796",NA,"""I'm very thankful that I have been saved such a dangerous exper-iment,"" said Captain Pullen, ""though if I thought that you would tie your handkerchief over my eyes and put my head in your lap, Madame, I should feel tempted to try it as soon as dinner is over!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21797",NA,"""Go along with you, you bad boy!"" chuckled the Baroness, ""there's something else to see this evening! They are going to 'ave a procession of lanterns as soon as it's dark!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21798",NA,"""And it is to stop in front of every hotel,"" added Harriet, ""and the landlords are going to distribute bonbons and gateaux amongst the lantern bearers.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21799",NA,"""O! we must not miss that on any account!"" replied Captain Pullen, addressing himself to her in reply.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21800",NA,"Margaret and Elinor thought, when the time came, that they should be able to see the procession of lanterns just as well from the balcony as when mingled with the crowd, so they brought their work and books down there and sat with Ralph, drinking coffee and conversing of all that had occurred. The Baroness had disappeared and Harriet Brandt had apparently gone with her-a fact for which both ladies were inwardly thankful.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21801",NA,"Presently, as the dusk fell, the procession of lanterns could be seen wending its way from the further end of the Digue. It was a very pretty and fantastical sight. The bearers were not only children-many grown men and women took part in it and the devices into which the Chinese lanterns had been formed were quaint and clever. Some held a ring around them, as milkmaids carry their pails-others held crosses and banners designed in tiny lanterns, far above their heads. One, which could be seen topping all the rest, was poised like a skipping rope over the bearer's shoulders, whilst the coloured lanterns swung inside it like a row of bells. The members of the procession shouted, or sung, or danced, or walked steadily as suited their temperaments and came along, a merry crowd up and down the Digue, stopping at the various hotels for largesse in the shape of cakes and sugar-plums.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21802",NA,"Ralph Pullen found his eyes wandering more than once in the direction of the Baroness's sitting-room to see if he could catch a glimpse of her or her protégée (as Harriet Brandt seemed now universally acknowledged to be), but he heard no sound, nor caught a glimpse of them, and concluded in consequence that they had left the hotel again.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21803",NA,"""Whoever is carrying that skipping rope of lanterns seems to be in a merry mood,"" observed Margaret after a while, ""for it is jumping up and down in the most extravagant manner! She must be dancing! Do look, Elinor!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21804",NA,"""I see! I suppose this sort of childish performance amuses a childish people, but for my own part I think once of it is quite enough and am thankful that we are not called upon to admire it in England!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21805",NA,"""O! I think it is rather interesting,"" remarked Margaret, ""I only wish my dear baby had been well enough to enjoy it! How she would have screamed and cooed at those bright coloured lanterns! But when I tried to attract her attention to them just now she only whined to be put into her cot again. How thankful I shall be to see dear Doctor Phillips to-morrow!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21806",NA,"The procession had reached the front of the Hotel by this time and halted there for refreshment. The waiters, Jules and Phillippe and Henri, appeared with plates of dessert and cakes and threw them indiscriminately amongst the people. One of the foremost to jump and scramble to catch the falling sweetmeats was the girl who carried the lantern skipping rope above her head and in whom Ralph Pullen, to his astonishment, recognised Harriet Brandt. There she was, fantastically dressed in a white frock and a broad yellow sash, with her magnificent hair loose and wreathed with scarlet flowers. She looked amazingly handsome, like a Bacchante, and her appearance and air of abandon sent the young man's blood into his face and up to the roots of his fair hair.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21807",NA,"""Surely!"" exclaimed Margaret, ""that is never Miss Brandt!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21808",NA,"""Yes! it is,"" cried Harriet, ""I'm having the most awful fun! Why don't you come too? I've danced the whole way up the Digue, and it is so warm! I wish the waiters would give us something to drink! I've eaten so many bonbons I feel quite sick!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21809",NA,"""What will you take, Miss Brandt?"" asked Captain Pullen eagerly, ""limonade or soda water?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21810",NA,"""A limonade, please! You are good!"" she replied, as he handed her the tumbler over the balcony balustrades. ""Come along and dance with me!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21811",NA,"""I cannot! I am with my sister and Miss Leyton!"" he replied.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21812",NA,"""O! pray do not let us prevent you,"" said Elinor in her coldest voice, ""Margaret was just going upstairs and I am quite ready to accompany her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21813",NA,"""No, no, Elinor,"" whispered Mrs. Pullen with a shake of her head, ""stay here and keep Ralph company!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21814",NA,"""But it is nearly ten o'clock,"" replied Miss Leyton consulting her watch, ""and I have been on my feet all day! and feel quite ready for bed. Good-night Ralph!"" she continued, offering him her hand.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21815",NA,"""Well! if you two are really going to bed I shall go too,"" said Captain Pullen rising, ""for there will be nothing for me to do here after you're gone!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21816",NA,"""Not even to follow the procession?"" suggested Miss Leyton, with a smile.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21817",NA,"""Don't talk nonsense!"" he rejoined crossly. ""Am I the sort of man to go bobbing up and down the Digue amongst a parcel of children?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21818",NA,"He shook hands with them both and walked away rather sulkily to his own quarter of the hotel. But he did not go to bed. He waited until some fifteen minutes had elapsed and then telling himself that it was impossible to sleep at that hour, and that if Elinor chose to behave like a bear it was not his fault, he came downstairs again and sauntered out on the sea front.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21819",NA,"It was very lonely there at that moment. The procession had turned and gone down to the other end again, where its lights and banners could be seen waving about in the still summer air.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21820",NA,"""Why shouldn't the girl jump about and enjoy herself if she chooses,"" thought Ralph Pullen, ""Elinor makes no allowances for condition or age, but would have every one as prim and old-maidish as herself. I declare she gets worse each time I see her! A nice sort of wife she will make if this kind of thing goes on! But by Jingo! if we are ever married I'll take her prudery out of her, and make her-what? The woman who commences by pursing her mouth up at everything ends by opening it wider than anybody else! There's twice as much harm in a prude as in one of these frank openhearted girls whose eyes tell you what they're thinking of the first time you see them!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21821",NA,"He had been strolling down the Digue as he pondered thus, and now found himself meeting the procession again.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21822",NA,"""Come and dance with me,"" cried Harriet Brandt who, apparently as fresh as ever, was still waving her branch of lanterns to the measure of her steps. He took her hand and tried to stop her.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21823",NA,"""Haven't you had about enough of this?"" he said, ""I'm sure you must be tired. Here's a little boy without a lantern! Give him yours to hold and come for a little walk with me!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21824",NA,"The touch of his cool hand upon her heated palm seemed to rouse all the animal in Harriet Brandt's blood. Her hand, very slight and lissom, clung to his with a force of which he had not thought it capable and he felt it trembling in his clasp.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21825",NA,"""Come!"" he repeated coaxingly, ""you mustn't dance any more or you will overtire yourself! Come with me and get cool and rest!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21826",NA,"She threw her branch of lanterns to the boy beside her impetuously.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21827",NA,"""Here!"" she cried, ""take them! I don't want them any more! And take me away,"" she continued to Ralph, but without letting go of his hand, ""You are right! I want-I want-rest!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21828",NA,"Her slight figure swayed towards him as he led her out of the crowd and across a narrow street to where the road ran behind all the houses and hotels and was dark and empty and void. The din of the voices, and the trampling of feet, and the echo of the songs still reached them, but they could see nothing-the world was on the Digue and they were in the dusk and quietude together-and alone.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21829",NA,"Ralph felt the slight form beside him lean upon his shoulder till their faces almost touched. He threw his arm about her waist. Her hot breath fanned his cheek.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21830",NA,"""Kiss me!"" she murmured in a dreamy voice. Captain Pullen was not slow to accept the invitation so confidingly extended. What Englishman would be? He turned his face to Harriet Brandt's, and her full red lips met his own in a long-drawn kiss that seemed to sap his vitality. As he raised his head again he felt faint and sick, but quickly recovering himself he gave her a second kiss more passionate, if possible, than the first. Then the following whispered conversation ensued between them. ""Do you know,"" he commenced, with his head close to hers, ""that you are the very jolliest little girl that I have ever met!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21831",NA,"""And you-you are the man I have dreamt of, but never seen till now!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21832",NA,"""How is that? Am I so different from the rest of my sex?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21833",NA,"""Very-very different! So strong and brave and beautiful!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21834",NA,"""Dear little girl! And so you really like me?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21835",NA,"""I love you,"" said Harriet feverishly, ""I loved you the first minute we met.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21836",NA,"""And I love you! You're awfully sweet and pretty, you know!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21837",NA,"""Do you really think so? What would Mrs. Pullen say if she heard you?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21838",NA,"""Mrs. Pullen is not the keeper of my conscience. But she must not hear it.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21839",NA,"""O! no! nor Miss Leyton either!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21840",NA,"""Most certainly not Miss Leyton. She is a terrible prude! She would be awfully shocked!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21841",NA,"""It must be a secret,-just between you and me!"" murmured the girl. ""Just so! A sweet little secret, all our own, and nobody else's!"" And then the fair head and the dark one came again in juxtaposition, and the rest was lost in-Silence!","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21842",NA,"- CHAPTER VII -","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21843",NA,"Doctor Phillips had not been in the Htel Lion d'Or five minutes before Margaret Pullen took him upstairs to see her baby. She was becoming terribly anxious about her. They encountered Captain Ralph Pullen on the staircase.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21844",NA,"""Hullo! young man, and what have you been doing to yourself?"" exclaimed the doctor.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21845",NA,"He was certainly looking ill. His face was chalky white, and his eyes seemed to have lost their brightness and colour.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21846",NA,"""Been up racketting late at night?"" continued Doctor Phillips. ""What is Miss Leyton about, not to look after you better?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21847",NA,"""No, indeed, Doctor,"" replied the young man with a smile, ""I am sure my sister-in-law will testify to the good hours I have kept since here. But I have a headache this morning-a rather bad one,"" he added, with his hand to the nape of his neck.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21848",NA,"""Perhaps this place doesn't agree with you-it was always rather famous for its smells if I remember aright! However, I am going to see Miss Ethel Pullen now and when I have finished with her I will look after you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21849",NA,"""No thank you, Doctor,"" said Ralph laughing, as he descended the stairs. ""None of your nostrums for me! Keep them for the baby!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21850",NA,"""He is not looking well,"" observed Doctor Phillips to Margaret, as they walked on together.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21851",NA,"""I don't think he is, now you point it out to me, but I have not noticed it before,"" replied Margaret. ""I am sure he has been living quietly enough whilst here!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21852",NA,"The infant was lying as she had now done for several days past- quite tranquil and free from pain but inert and half asleep. The doctor raised her eyelids and examined her eyeballs-felt her pulse and listened to her heart-but he did not seem to be satisfied.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21853",NA,"""What has this child been having?"" he asked abruptly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21854",NA,"""Having, Doctor? Why! nothing of course, but her milk, and I have always that from the same cow!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21855",NA,"""No opium-no soothing syrup, nor quackeries of any kind?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21856",NA,"""Certainly not! You know how often you have warned me against anything of the sort!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21857",NA,"""And no one has had the charge of her except you and the nurse here? You can both swear she has never been tampered with?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21858",NA,"""O! I think so, certainly, yes! Baby has never been from under the eye of one or the other of us. A young lady resident in the hotel-a Miss Brandt-has often nursed her and played with her but one of us has always been there at the time.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21859",NA,"""A Miss-what did you say?"" demanded the doctor sharply.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21860",NA,"""A Miss Brandt-a very good-natured girl, who is fond of children!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21861",NA,"""Very well then! I will go at once to the pharmacien's and get a prescription made up for your baby, and I hope that your anxiety may soon be relieved!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21862",NA,"""O! thank you, Doctor, so much!"" exclaimed Margaret. ""I knew you would do her good as soon as you saw her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21863",NA,"But the doctor was not so sure of himself. He turned the case over and over in his mind as he walked to the chemist's shop wondering how such a state of exhaustion and collapse could have been brought about.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21864",NA,"The baby had her first dose and the doctor had just time to wash and change his travelling suit before they all met at the dinner table.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21865",NA,"Here they found the party opposite augmented by the arrival of Monsieur Alfred Brimont, a young Brussels tradesman who had come over to Heyst to conduct his sister home. He was trying to persuade Harriet Brandt to accompany Olga and stay a few days with them but the girl-with a long look in the direction of Captain Pullen-shook her head determinately.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21866",NA,"""O! you might come, Harriet, just for a few days,"" argued Olga, ""now that the Bataille des Fleurs is over there is nothing left to stay for in Heyst, and Alfred says that Brussels is such a beautiful place.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21867",NA,"""There are the theatres, and the Parc, and the Quinçonce, and Wauxhall!"" said young Brimont persuasively, ""Mademoiselle would enjoy herself, I have no doubt!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21868",NA,"But Harriet still negatived the proposal.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21869",NA,"""Why shouldn't we make up a party and all go together,"" suggested the Baroness. ""Me and the Baron and Bobby and 'Arriet? You would like it then, my dear, wouldn't you?"" she said to the girl, ""and you really should see Brussels before we go 'ome! What do you say, Gustave? We'd go to the Hotel de Saxe, and see everything! It wouldn't take us more than a week or ten days.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21870",NA,"""Do as you like, mein tear,"" acquiesced the Baron.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21871",NA,"""And why shouldn't you come with us, Captain?"" continued Madame Gobelli to Ralph. ""You don't look quite the thing to me! A little change would do you good. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy! 'Ave you been to Brussels?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21872",NA,"""I lived there for years, Madame, and know every part of it!"" he replied.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21873",NA,"""Come and renew your acquaintance then, and take me and 'Arriet about! The Baron isn't much good when it comes to sightseeing, are you, Gustave? 'E likes 'is pipe and 'is slippers too well! But you're young and spry! Well! is it a bargain?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21874",NA,"""I really could not decide in such a hurry,"" said Ralph, with a glance at Margaret and Elinor, ""but we might all go to Brussels perhaps, a little later on.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21875",NA,"""I don't think you must buoy up the hopes of the Baroness and Miss Brandt with that idea,"" remarked Miss Leyton coldly, ""because I am sure that Mrs. Pullen has no intention of doing anything of the sort. If you wish to accompany Madame Gobelli's party you had better make your arrangements without any reference to us!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21876",NA,"""All right! If you prefer it, I will,"" he answered in the same indifferent tone.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21877",NA,"""Who is that young lady sitting opposite with the dark eyes?"" demanded Doctor Phillips of Mrs. Pullen.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21878",NA,"""The same I spoke to you of upstairs as having been kind to baby-Miss Harriet Brandt!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21879",NA,"""I knew a Brandt once,"" he answered. ""Has she anything to do with the West Indies?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21880",NA,"""O! yes! she comes from Jamaica! She is an orphan, the daughter of Doctor Henry Brandt, and has been educated in the Ursuline Convent there! She is a young lady with an independent fortune and considered to be quite a catch in Heyst!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21881",NA,"""And you and Miss Leyton are intimate with her?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21882",NA,"""She has attached herself very much to us since coming here. She has few friends, poor girl!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21883",NA,"""Will you introduce me?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21884",NA,"""Miss Brandt, my friend, Doctor Phillips, wishes for an introduction to you.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21885",NA,"The usual courtesies passed between them and then the doctor said,","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21886",NA,"""I fancy I knew your father, Miss Brandt, when I was quartered in Jamaica with the Thirteenth Lances. Did he not live on the top of the Hill, on a plantation called Helvetia?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21887",NA,"""That was the name of our place,"" replied Harriet, ""but I left it when I was only eleven. My trustee Mr. Trawler lives there now!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21888",NA,"""Ah! Trawler the attorney! I have no doubt he made as much out of the property as he could squeeze.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21889",NA,"""Do you mean that he cheated me?"" asked Harriet, naïvely.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21890",NA,"""God forbid! my dear young lady. But he was a great crony of your father's, and a d-d sharp lawyer, and those sort of gentry generally feather their own nest pretty well, in payment of their friendship.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21891",NA,"""He can't do me any harm now,"" said Harriet, ""for I have my property in my own hands!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21892",NA,"""Quite right! quite right! that is, if you're a business woman,"" rejoined the doctor. ""And are you travelling all by yourself ?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21893",NA,"Harriet was about to answer in the affirmative when the Baroness took the words out of her mouth.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21894",NA,"""No, Sir, she ain't! She came over with her friend, Mademoiselle Brimont, and now she's under my chaperonage. She's a deal too 'andsome, ain't she? to be travelling about the world alone with her money-bags under her arm. My name's the Baroness Gobelli,- this is my 'usband, Baron Gustave Gobelli, and this is my little boy, Bobby Bates-by my first 'usband you'll understand-and when you return to London, if you like to come and see Miss Brandt at our 'ouse-the Red 'Ouse, 'Olloway, we shall be very pleased to see you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21895",NA,"""I am sure, Madame, you are infinitely kind,"" replied Doctor Phillips gravely.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21896",NA,"""Not at all! You'll meet no end of swells there, Prince Loris of Taxelmein, and Prince Adalbert of Waxsquiemer, and 'eaps of others. But all the same we're in trade, the Baron and I-and we're not ashamed of it either. We make boots and shoes! Our firm is Fantaisie et Cie, of Oxford Street and though I say it, you won't find better boots and shoes in all London than ours. No brown paper soles and rotten uppers! Not a bit of it! It's all genuine stuff with us. You can take any boot out of the shop and rip it to pieces and prove what I say! The best materials and the best workmen, that's our principle, and it answers. We can't make 'em fast enough!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21897",NA,"""I have no doubt of it,"" again, gravely, responded the old doctor.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

Some twelve or thirteen years ago I was quartered in medical charge of the Thirteenth Lances and stationed in Jamaica where I knew of, rather than knew, the father of this girl, Henry Brandt.

The Swiss laboratories are renowned for being the most foremost in Vivisection and other branches of science that gratify the curiosity and harden the heart of man more than they confer any lasting benefit on humanity. Even there Henry Brandt's barbarity was considered to render him unfit for association with civilized practitioners, and he was expelled with ignominy. Having a private fortune he settled in Jamaica and set up his laboratory there, and I would not shock your ears by detailing one hundredth part of the atrocities that were said to take place under his supervision and in company of this man Trawler, whom the girl calls her trustee, and who is one of the greatest brutes unhung.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

He was known to have decoyed natives into his Pandemonium[104] who were never heard of again which, raised at last, the public feeling so much against him that, I am glad to say, his negroes revolted and, after having murdered him with appropriate atrocity, set fire to his house and burned it and all his property to the ground. Don't look so shocked!

A fat, flabby half caste who hardly ever moved out of her chair but sat eating all day long until the power to move had almost left her! I can see her now with her sensual mouth, her greedy eyes, her low forehead and half-formed brain, and her lust for blood. It was said that the only thing which made her laugh was to watch the dying agonies of the poor creatures her brutal protector slaughtered. But she thirsted for blood, she loved the sight and smell of it, she would taste it on the tip of her finger when it came in her way. Her servants had some story amongst themselves to account for this lust. They declared that when her slave mother was pregnant with her she was bitten by a Vampire bat, which are formidable creatures in the West Indies and are said to fan their victims to sleep with their enormous wings whilst they suck their blood. Anyway the slave woman did not survive her delivery and her fellows prophecied that the child would grow up to be a murderess.

She may seem harmless enough at present, so does the tiger cub as it suckles its dam, but that which is bred in her will come out sooner or later and curse those with whom she may be associated. I beg and pray of you, Margaret, not to let that girl come near you or your child any more.

I don't mean anything particular, for (as you know) he is engaged to be married to Elinor Leyton and I don't suspect him of wronging her, only-young men are rather headstrong you know and fond of their own way, and perhaps if you were to speak to Ralph-""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

I hardly know how to make my meaning clear to you, Margaret, but Miss Brandt is a dangerous acquaintance for all of you. We medical men know the consequences of heredity better than outsiders can do. A woman born in such circumstances-bred of sensuality, cruelty, and heartlessness-cannot, in the order of things, be modest, kind, or sympathetic. And she probably carries unknown dangers in her train. Whatever her fascinations or her position may be, I beg of you to drop her at once and for ever!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

"21941",NA,"Just then Harriet Brandt's beautiful voice, accompanied by the silvery strains of the mandoline, was heard to warble Gounod's ""Marguerite""[105] from the open window of the Baroness's sitting-room. Margaret glanced up. The apartment was brilliantly lighted-on the table were bottles of wine and spirits, with cakes and fruit, and Madame Gobelli's bulky form might be seen leaning over the dishes. She had assembled quite a little party there that night. The two Brimonts were present, and Captain Pullen's tall figure was distinctly visible under the lamplight. Harriet was seated on the sofa and her full voice filled the atmosphere with melody.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

"21945",NA,"""And see, Doctor, there is Ralph,"" continued Margaret, pointing out her brother-in-law. ""I left him with Miss Leyton. He must have got rid of her by some means and crept up to the Gobellis. He cannot care for them. He is so refined, so fastidious with regard to people in general that a woman like the Baroness must grate upon his feelings every time she opens her mouth, and the Baron never opens his at all. He can only frequent their company for the sake of Harriet Brandt! I have seen it for some time past and it has made me very uneasy.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

"21948",NA,"""It is impossible to say, Margaret-I should not like to give an opinion on the subject.

"21954",NA,"""I don't doubt it, but I can't deny that there are symptoms about her case that I do not understand. She seems to have had all her strength drawn out of her. She is in the condition of a child who has been exercised and excited and hurried from place to place, far beyond what she is able to bear. But it may arise from internal causes. I shall be better able to judge to-morrow when my medicine has had its effect. Good-night, my dear, and don't worry.

"21962",NA,"""O! I'm sure she would!"" cried Harriet, all the blood in her body flying into her face, ""she is so very kind to me!

"21967",NA,"""Yes, Madame, if you'll take charge of me!"" said Miss Brandt.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

"21972",NA,"- CHAPTER VIII -","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21973",NA,"Doctor Phillips was a man of sixty and a bachelor. He had never made any home ties for himself, and was therefore more inter-ested in Margaret Pullen (whose father had been one of his dearest friends) than he might otherwise have been. He feared that a heavy trial lay before her and he was unwilling to see it aggravated by any misconduct on the part of her brother-in-law. He could see that the young man was (to say the least of it) not behaving fairly towards his fiancée, Elinor Leyton, and he was determined to open his eyes to the true state of affairs with regard to Harriet Brandt. He spent a sleepless night, his last visit to Margaret's suffering child having strengthened his opinion as to her hopeless condition, and he lay awake wondering how he should break the news to the poor young mother. He rose with the intention of speaking to Ralph without delay, but he found it more difficult to get a word with him than he had anticipated. The Gobelli party had decided to start with the Brimonts that afternoon and Captain Pullen stuck to them the entire morning, ostensibly to assist the Baroness in her preparations for departure, but in reality, as anyone could see, to linger by the side of Miss Brandt. Miss Leyton perceived her lover's defalcation as plainly as the rest but she was too proud to make a hint upon the subject, even to Margaret Pullen. She sat alone in the balcony, reading a book, and gave no sign of annoyance or discomfiture. But a close observer might have seen the trembling of her lip when she attempted to speak, and the fixed, white look upon her face which betrayed her inward anxiety. It made Margaret's kind heart ache to see her, and Doctor Phillips more indignant with Ralph Pullen than before.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21974",NA,"The party for Brussels had arranged to travel by the three o'clock train and at the appointed time the doctor was ready in the balcony to accompany them to the entrept. There were no cabs in Heyst, the station being in the town. Luggage was conveyed backwards and forwards in handcarts drawn by the porters, and travellers invariably walked to their destination. The Baroness appeared dressed for her journey in an amazing gown of blue velvet trimmed with rare Maltese lace, with a heavy mantle over it and a small hat on her head which made her round, flat, unmeaning face, look coarser than before. She used the Herr Baron as a walking stick as usual whilst Harriet Brandt, in a white frock and large hat shading her glowing eyes under a scarlet parasol, looked like a tropical bird skimming by her side, with Captain Pullen in close attendance carrying a flimsy wrap in case she should require it before she reached her journey's end. The Brimonts, following in the rear, were of no account beside their more brilliant and important friends.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21975",NA,"Ralph Pullen did not look pleased when he saw Doctor Phillips join the party.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21976",NA,"""Are you also going to the entrept?"" he exclaimed, ""what can you find to interest you there?-a dirty little smutty place! I am going just to help the ladies over the line as there is no bridge for crossing.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21977",NA,"""Perhaps I am bent on the same errand,"" replied the doctor, ""do you give me credit for less gallantry than yourself, Pullen?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21978",NA,"""That's right, Doctor,"" said the Baroness, ""and I've no doubt you'll be very useful! My Bobby ain't any manner of good, and the Baron 'as so many traps to carry that 'e 'asn't got an arm to spare. I only wish you were coming with us! Why don't you make up your mind to come over with Captain Pullen the day after to-morrow, and 'ave a little 'oliday?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21979",NA,"""I was not aware that Captain Pullen was going to Brussels, Madame! I fancy he will have to get Miss Leyton's consent first!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21980",NA,"At the mention of Miss Leyton's name in connection with himself Ralph Pullen flushed uneasily and Harriet Brandt turned a look of startled enquiry upon the speaker.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21981",NA,"""O! 'ang Miss Leyton!"" retorted the Baroness, graphically, ""she surely wouldn't stop Captain Pullen's fun just because 'e's staying with 'is sister-in-law! I should call that very 'ard. You can't always tie a young man to 'is relations' apron-strings, Doctor!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21982",NA,"""Not always, Madame!"" he replied, and dropped the subject.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21983",NA,"""You wouldn't let Miss Leyton or Mrs. Pullen keep you from me!"" whispered Harriet to her cavalier.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

"21985",NA,"They had reached the little station by this time and the porters were calling out vociferously that the train was about to start for Brussels, so that in the hurry of procuring their tickets and conveying the ladies and the luggage across the cinder-besprinkled line to where the train stood puffing to be off, there was no more time to exchange sentimentalities or excite suspicion. The party being safely stowed away in their carriage, Ralph Pullen and Doctor Phillips stood on the wooden platform with their hats off, bowing their farewells.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"21986",NA,"""Mind you don't put off your coming after Thursday!"" screamed the Baroness to Ralph, as she filled up the entire window with her bulky person, ""we shall expect you by dinner-time!

"21988",NA,"""O! well! I 'ope you're going to keep your word, or we shall come back to 'Eyst in double quick time. Good-bye! Good-bye!"" and kissing her fat hand to the two gentlemen, the Baroness was whisked out of Heyst.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

Your brother Arthur is one of my greatest chums, and his wife's father was, without exception, my dearest friend-added to this, I am on intimate terms with the Waltham-stowes. Knowing what I do, therefore, I should hold myself criminal if I left you in ignorance of the truth concerning this young woman.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22001",NA,"""Are you alluding, may I ask, to Miss Brandt?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22002",NA,"""I am alluding to the girl who calls herself by that name but who is in reality only the bastard daughter of Henry Brandt, one of the most infamous men whom God ever permitted to desecrate this earth, and his half-caste mistress.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22003",NA,"""Be careful what you say, Doctor Phillips!"" said Ralph Pullen, with ill-suppressed wrath gleaming in his blue eyes.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22004",NA,"""There is no need to be, my dear fellow. I can verify everything I say, and I fear no man's resentment. I was stationed in Jamaica with my regiment some fifteen years ago when this girl was a child of six years old, running half naked about her father's plantation, uncared for by either parent and associating solely with the negro servants. Brandt was a brute-the perpetrator of such atrocities in vivisection and other scientific experiments that he was finally slaughtered on his own plantation by his servants, and everyone said it served him right. The mother was the most awful woman I have ever seen, and my experience of the sex in back slums and alleys has not been small. She was the daughter of a certain Judge Carey of Barbadoes by one of his slave girls and Brandt took her as his mistress before she was fourteen. At thirty, when I saw her, she was a revolting spectacle. Gluttonous and obese-her large eyes rolling and her sensual lips protruding as if she were always licking them in anticipation of her prey. She was said to be 'Obeah' too by the natives and they ascribed all the deaths and diseases that took place on the plantation to her malign influence. Consequently, when they got her in their clutches I have heard that they did not spare her, but killed her in the most torturing fashion they could devise.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22005",NA,"""And did the British Government take no notice of the massacre?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22006",NA,"""There was an enquiry, of course, but the actual perpetrator of the murders could not be traced and so the matter died out. The hatred and suspicion in which Brandt had been held for some time had a great effect upon the verdict, for in addition to his terrible experiments upon animals-experiments which he performed simply for his own grati-fication and for no use that he made of them in treating his fellow creatures-he had been known to decoy diseased and old natives into his laboratory, after which they were never seen again, and it was the digging up of human bones on the plantation which finally roused the negroes to such a pitch of indignation that they rose en masse, and after murdering both Brandt and his abominable mistress they set fire to the house and burned it to the ground. There is no doubt but that if the overseer of the plantation, an African negro named Pete, had not carried off the little girl, she would have shared the fate of her parents. And who can say if it would not have been as well if she had!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22007",NA,"""I really cannot see what right you have to give vent to such a sentiment!"" exclaimed Captain Pullen. ""What has this terrible story got to do with Miss Brandt?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

"22010",NA,"""Does she not? Your assertion only proves your ignorance of character or characteristics. The girl is a quadroon, and she shews it distinctly in her long-shaped eyes with their blue whites and her wide mouth and blood-red lips! Also in her supple figure and apparently boneless hands and feet. Of her personal character, I have naturally had no opportunity of judging, but I can tell you by the way she eats her food, and the way in which she uses her eyes, that she has inherited her half-caste mother's greedy and sensual disposition. And in ten years' time she will in all probability have no figure at all! She will run to fat. I could tell that also at a glance!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22011",NA,"""And have you any more compliments to pay the young lady?"" enquired Captain Pullen, sarcastically.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

Come, my dear boy, be reasonable! This girl has attracted you, I suppose! We are all subject to a woman's influence at times, but you must not let it go further. You must break it off and this is an excellent opportunity to do so! Your sister's infant is, I fear, seriously ill. Take your party on to Ostende and send the Baroness a polite note to say that you are prevented from going to Brussels and all will be right! You will take my advice-will you not?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22015",NA,"""No! I'll be hanged if I will,"" exclaimed the young man. ""I am not a boy to be ordered here and there, as if I were not fit to take care of myself.

"22019",NA,"""I cannot see why my brother's opinion, or Lord Walthamstowe's thoughts, should interfere with the happiness of my whole life,"" rejoined Ralph sullenly. ""However, let that pass! The question on the tapis is my acquaintance with Miss Brandt, and which you consider should be put a stop to. For what reason? If what you bring against her is true, it appears to me that she has all the more need of the protection and loyalty of her friends. It would be cowardly to desert a girl just because her father and mother happened to be brutes. It is not her fault!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22020",NA,"""I quite allow that! Neither is it the fault of a madman that his progenitors had lunacy in their blood, nor of a consumptive that his were strumous.[106] All the same the facts affect their lives and the lives of those with whom they come in contact.

"22021",NA,"""Well! and if so, how can it concern anyone but the poor child herself?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22022",NA,"""O! yes it can and it will! And if I am not greatly mistaken Harriet Brandt carries a worse curse with her even than that! She possesses the fatal attributes of the Vampire that affected her mother's birth-that endued her with the thirst for blood which characterised her life-that will make Harriet draw upon the health and strength of all with whom she may be intimately associated-that may render her love fatal to such as she may cling to! I must tell you, Pullen, that I fear we have already proofs of this in the illness of your little niece whom, her mother tells me, was at one time scarcely ever out of Miss Brandt's arms. I have no other means of accounting for her sudden failure of strength and vitality. You need not stare at me as if you thought I do not know what I am talking about! There are many cases like it in the world. Cases of persons who actually feed upon the lives of others, as the deadly upas tree[107] sucks the life of its victim, by lulling him into a sleep from which he never wakens!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

"22024",NA,"""All the worse for poor little Ethel! I do not say she does harm intentionally or even consciously, but that the deadly attributes of her bloodthirsty parents have descended on her in this respect, I have not a shadow of doubt! If you watch that young woman's career through life you will see that those she apparently cares for most, and clings to most, will soonest fade out of existence, whilst she continues to live all the stronger that her victims die!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22025",NA,"""Rubbish! I don't believe it!"" replied Ralph sturdily. ""You medical men generally have some crotchet in your brains, but this is the most wonderful bee that ever buzzed in a bonnet!

"22026",NA,"""You have tried it, Pullen, in a mild form, and it has had its effect on you! You are not the same fellow who came over to Heyst, though by all rules you should be looking better and stronger for the change.

But you must not breathe a suspicion to her concerning the child's illness or I verily believe she would murder Miss Brandt!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22027",NA,"""Putting all this nonsense aside,"" said Ralph, ""do you consider Margaret's baby to be seriously ill?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22028",NA,"""Very seriously. My medicines have not had the slightest effect upon her condition, which is inexplicable. Her little life is being slowly sapped. She may cease to breathe at any moment.

"22029",NA,"""How disappointed poor Arthur will be!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22030",NA,"""Yes! but his grief will be nothing to the mother's. She is quite devoted to her child!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22031",NA,"By mutual consent they had dropped the subject of Harriet Brandt and now spoke only of family affairs. Ralph was a kindhearted fellow under all his conceit and felt very grave at the prospect held out in regard to his baby niece.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22032",NA,"The fulfilment of the prophecy came sooner than even Doctor Phillips had anticipated. As they were all sitting at dinner that evening, Madame Lamont, her eyes over-brimming with tears, rushed unceremoniously into the salle à manger calling to Margaret.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22033",NA,"""Madame! Madame! please come up to your room at once! The dear baby is worse!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22034",NA,"Margaret threw one agonised glance at Doctor Phillips and rushed from the room followed by himself and Elinor Leyton. The high staircase seemed interminable-more than once Margaret's legs failed under her and she thought she should never reach the top. But she did so all too soon. On the bed was laid the infant form, limp and lifeless, and Martin the nurse met them at the door, bathed in tears.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22035",NA,"""O! Ma'am!"" she cried, ""it happened all of a minute! She was lying on my lap, pretty dear, just as usual, when she went off in a convulsion and died.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22036",NA,"""Died, died!"" echoed Margaret in a bewildered voice, ""Doctor Phillips! who is it that has died?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22037",NA,"""The baby, Ma'am, the dear baby! She went off like a lamb, without a struggle! O! dear mistress, do try to bear it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22038",NA,"""Is my baby-dead?"" said Margaret in the same dazed voice, turning to the doctor who had already satisfied himself that the tiny heart and pulse had ceased to beat.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22039",NA,"""No! my dear child, she is not dead-she is living-with God! Try to think of her as quite happy and free from this world's ill.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22040",NA,"""O! but I wanted her so-I wanted her,"" exclaimed the bereaved mother, as she clasped the senseless form in her arms, ""O! baby! baby! why did you go before you had seen your father?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22041",NA,"And then she slid, rather than sank, from the bedside, in a tumbled heap upon the floor.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22042",NA,"""It is better so-it will help her through it,"" said Doctor Phillips, as he directed the nurse to carry the dead child into Elinor Leyton's room and placed Margaret on her own bed. ""You will not object, Miss Leyton, I am sure, and you must not leave Mrs. Pullen to-night!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22043",NA,"""Of course I shall not,"" replied Elinor, ""I have been afraid for days past that this would happen, but poor Margaret would not take any hints.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22044",NA,"She spoke sympathetically, but there were no tears in her eyes and she did not caress, nor attempt to console her friend. She did all that was required of her but there was no spontaneous suggestion on her part with regard either to the mother or the dead child, and as Doctor Phillips noted her coolness, he did not wonder so much at Ralph's being attracted by the fervour and warmth of Harriet Brandt.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22045",NA,"As soon as poor Margaret had revived and had her cry out he administered a sleeping draught to her, and leaving her in charge of Elinor Leyton, he went downstairs again to consult Captain Pullen as to what would be the best thing for them to do.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22046",NA,"Ralph was very much shocked to hear of the baby's sudden death, and eager to do all in his power for his brother's wife. There was no Protestant cemetery in Heyst, and Doctor Phillips proposed that they should at once order a little shell and convey the child's body either to Ostende or England, as Margaret might desire, for burial. The sooner she left the place where she had lost her child, he said, the better, and his idea was that she would wish the body to be taken to Devonshire and buried in the quiet country churchyard where her husband's father and mother were laid to sleep. He left Ralph to telegraph to his brother in India and to anyone the news might concern in England-also to settle all hotel claims and give notice to the Lamonts that they would leave on the morrow.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22047",NA,"""But supposing Margaret should object,"" suggested Ralph.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22048",NA,"""She will not object!"" replied the Doctor, ""she might if we were not taking the child's body with us, but as it is she will be grateful to be thought and acted for. She is a true woman, God bless her! I only wish He had not seen fit to bring this heavy trial on her head!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22049",NA,"Not a word was exchanged between the two men about Harriet Brandt. Ralph, remembering the hint the doctor had thrown out respecting her being the ultimate cause of the baby's illness, did not like to bring up her name again-felt rather guilty with respect to it, indeed-and Doctor Phillips was only too glad to see the young man bestirring himself to be useful, and losing sight of his own worry in the trouble of his sister-in-law. Of course he could not have refused, or even demurred, at accompanying his party to England on so mournful an errand-and to do him justice he did not wish it to be otherwise. Brussels and its anticipated pleasures had been driven clean out of his head by the little tragedy that had occurred in Heyst, and his attitude towards Margaret when they met again was so quietly affectionate and brotherly that he was of infinite comfort to her. She quite acquiesced in Doctor Phillips' decision that her child should be buried with her father's family and the mournful group, with the little coffin in their midst, set out without delay for Devonshire.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22050",NA,"- CHAPTER IX -","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22051",NA,"Harriet Brandt set off for Brussels in the best of spirits. Captain Pullen had pledged himself to follow her in a couple of days and had sketched, with a free hand, the pleasure they would mutually enjoy in each other's company without the fear of Mrs. Pullen or Miss Leyton popping on them round the corner. Madame Gobelli also much flattered her vanity by speaking of Ralph as if he were her confessed lover and prospective fiancé so that, what with the new scenes she was passing through and her anticipated good fortune, Harriet was half delirious with delight and looked as ""handsome as paint"" in consequence.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22052",NA,"Olga Brimont, on the contrary, although quietly happy in the prospect of keeping house for her brother, did not share in the transports of her Convent companion. Alfred Brimont observed, more than once, that she seemed to visibly shrink from Miss Brandt and took an early opportunity of asking her the reason why. But all her answer was conveyed in a shrug of the shoulders, and a request that he would not leave her at the Hotel de Saxe with the rest of the party, but take her home at once to the rooms over which she was to preside for him. In consequence, the two Brimonts said good-bye to the Gobellis and Harriet Brandt at the Brussels station and drove to their apartments in the rue de Vienne, after which the others saw no more of them. The Baroness declared they were ""a good riddance of bad rubbish,"" and that she had never liked that pasty-faced Mademoiselle Brimont and believed that she was jealous of the brilliancy and beauty of her dear 'Arriet. The Baroness had conceived one of her violent and generally short-lived fancies for the girl, and nothing, for the time being, was too good for her. She praised her looks and her talents in the most extravagant manner and told everyone at the Hotel that the Baron and she had known her from infancy-that she was their ward-and that they regarded her as the daughter of the house, with various other falsehoods that made Harriet open her dark eyes with amazement, whilst she felt that she could not afford to put a sudden end to her friendship with Madame Gobelli by denying them. Brussels is a very pretty town, full of modern and ancient interest, and there was plenty for them to see and hear during their first days there. But Harriet was resolved to defer visiting the best sights until Captain Pullen had joined them.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22053",NA,"She went to the concerts at the Quinconce and Wauxhall, and visited the Zoological Gardens, but she would not go to the Musée nor the Académie des Beaux Arts, nor the Cathedral of Sainte Gudule, whilst Ralph remained in Heyst. Madame Gobelli laughed at her for her reticence-called her a sly cat-said she supposed they must make up their minds to see nothing of her when the handsome Captain came to Brussels-finally sending her off in company of Bobby to walk in the Parc, or visit the Wiertz Museum.[108] The Baroness was not equal to much walking at the best of times, and had been suffering from rheumatism lately, so that she and the Baron did most of their sight-seeing in a carriage and left the young people to amuse themselves. Bobby was very proud to be elected Miss Brandt's cavalier, and get out of the way of his formidable Mamma who made his table d'hte life a terror to him. He was a well-grown lad and not bad-looking. In his blue eyes and white teeth he took after his mother, but his hair and his complexion were fair. He was an anæmic young fellow and very delicate, being never without a husky cough which, however, the Baroness seemed to consider of no consequence. He hardly ever opened his mouth in the presence of his parents unless it were to remonstrate against the Baroness's strictures on his appearance or his conduct, but Harriet Brandt found he could be communicative enough when he was alone with her. He gave her lengthy descriptions of the Red House and the treasures which it contained-of his Mamma's barouche lined with satin-of the large garden which they had at Holloway, with its greenhouses and hothouses, and the numbers of people who came to visit them there.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22054",NA,"""O! yes!"" rejoined Harriet, ""the Baroness has told me about them, Prince Adalbert and Prince Loris and others! She said they often came to the Red House! I should like to know them very much!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22055",NA,"The youth looked at her in a mysterious manner.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22056",NA,"""Yes! they do come, very often, and plenty of other people with them; the Earl of Waterhouse and Lord Drinkwater, and Lady Mountacue, and more than I know the names of. But-but-did Mamma tell you why they come?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22057",NA,"""No! not exactly! To see her and the Baron, I suppose!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22058",NA,"""Well! yes! for that too perhaps,"" stammered Bobby. ""But there is another reason. Mamma is very wonderful you know! She can tell people things they never knew before. And she has a room where- but I had better not say any more. You might repeat it to her and then she would be so angry."" The two were on their way to the Wiertz Museum at the time, and Harriet's curiosity was excited.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22059",NA,"""I will not, I promise you, Bobby,"" she said, ""what has the Baroness in that room?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22060",NA,"Bobby drew near enough to whisper, as he replied, ""O! I don't know, I daren't say, but horrible things go on there! Mamma has threatened some times to make me go in with her, but I wouldn't for all the world. Our servants will never stay with us long. One girl told me before she left that Mamma was a witch and could raise up the dead. Do you think it can be true-that it is possible?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22061",NA,"""I don't know,"" said Harriet, ""and I don't want to know! There are no dead that I want to see back again, unless indeed it were dear old Pete, our overseer. He was the best friend I ever had. One night our house was burned to the ground and lots of the things in it, and old Pete wrapped me up in a blanket and carried me to his cabin in the jungle and kept me safe until my friends were able to send me to the Convent. I shall never forget that. I should like to see old Pete again, but I don't believe the Baroness could bring him back. It wants 'Obeah' to do that!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22062",NA,"""What is 'Obeah,' Miss Brandt?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22063",NA,"""Witchcraft, Bobby!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22064",NA,"""Is it wicked?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22065",NA,"""I don't know. I know nothing about it! But let us talk of something else. I don't believe your Mamma can do anything more than other people, and she only says it to frighten you. But you mustn't tell her I said so. Is this the Wiertz Museum? I thought it would be a much grander place!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22066",NA,"""I heard father say that it is the house Wiertz lived in, and he left it with all his pictures to the Belgian Government on condition they kept it just as it was.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22067",NA,"They entered the gallery and Harriet Brandt, although not a great lover of painting in general, stood enwrapt before most of the pictures. She passed over the ""Bouton de Rose"" and the sacred paintings with a cursory glance but the representation of Napoleon in Hell being fed with the blood and bones of his victims-of the mother in a time of famine devouring her child-and of the Suicide between his good and evil angels, appeared to absorb all her senses. Her eyes fixed themselves upon the canvasses, she stood before them entranced, enraptured, and when Bobby touched her arm as a hint to come and look at something else she drew a long breath as though she had been suddenly aroused from sleep. Again and again she returned to the same spot, the pictures holding her with a strange fascination which she could not shake off, and when she returned to the Hotel she declared that first thing she should do on the following morning would be to go back to the Wiertz Museum and gaze once more upon those inimitable figures.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22068",NA,"""But such 'orrid, subjects my dear,"" said the Baroness, ""Bobby says they were all blood and bones!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22069",NA,"""But I like them-I like them!"" replied Harriet, moving her tongue slowly over her lips, ""they interest me! They are so life-like!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22070",NA,"""Well! to-morrow will be Thursday, you know, so I expect you will have somebody's else's wishes to consult! You will 'ave a letter by the early post, you may depend upon it, to say that the Captain will be with us by dinner-time!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22071",NA,"Harriet Brandt flushed a deep rose. It was when the colour came into her usually pale cheeks, and her eyes awaked from their slumbers and sparkled that she looked beautiful. On the present occasion as she glanced up to see Bobby Bates regarding her with steadfast surprise and curiosity, she blushed still more.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22072",NA,"""You'll be 'aving a fine time of it, together, you two, I expect,"" continued the Baroness facetiously, ""and Bobby, 'ere, will 'ave to content 'imself with me and his Papa! But we'll all go to the theatre together to-morrow night. I've taken five seats for the Alcazar, which the Captain said was the house he liked best in Brussels.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22073",NA,"""How good you are to me!"" exclaimed Harriet, as she wound her slight arms about the uncouth form of the Baroness.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22074",NA,"""Good! Nonsense! Why! Gustave and I look upon you as our daughter, and you're welcome to share everything that is ours. You can come and live altogether at the Red 'Ouse, if you like!

"22075",NA,"""O! don't talk of such a thing, pray don't!"" said the girl, hiding her face in the Baroness's ample bosom, ""you know there is nothing as yet-only a pleasant friendship.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22076",NA,"""He! he! he!"" chuckled Madame Gobelli, ""so that's what you call a pleasant friendship, eh? I wonder what Captain Pullen calls it! I expect we shall 'ear in a few days. But what 'e thinks is of no consequence, so long as you don't commit yourself till you've looked about you a little. I do want you to meet Prince Adalbert! 'Is 'air's like flax-such a nice contrast to yours. And you speaking French so well! You would get on first-rate together!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

"22084",NA,"""But we mustn't leave him alone,"" said the girl, kindly. ""I shouldn't enjoy my drive if we were to do so!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22085",NA,"The lad gave her a grateful glance through eyes that were already moist with the prospect of disappointment.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22086",NA,"""Very well then,"" said Madame Gobelli, ""if you will 'ave your own way, 'e may come, but you must take all the trouble of 'im, 'Arriet, mind that!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22087",NA,"Bobby was only too happy to accompany the party, even in these humiliating circumstances, and they all set out together for the Bois de Cambres. The next day was looked forward to by Harriet Brandt as one of certain happiness, but the morning post arrived without bringing the anticipated notice from Ralph Pullen that he should join them as arranged in the afternoon. The piteous eyes that she lifted to the Baroness's face as she discovered the defalcation were enough to excite the compassion of anyone.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22088",NA,"""It's all right!"" said her friend, across the breakfast table. ""'E said 'e would come, so there's no need of writing. Besides, it was much safer not! 'E couldn't stir, I daresay, without one of those two cats, Mrs. Pullen or Miss Leyton, at 'is elbow, so 'e thought they might find out what 'e was after, and prevent 'is starting. Say they wanted to leave 'Eyst or something, just to keep 'im at their side! You mark my words, I've means of finding out things that you know nothing of, and I've just seen it written over your 'ead that 'e'll be 'ere by dinner time, so you can go out for your morning's jaunt in perfect comfort!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22089",NA,"Harriet brightened up at this prophecy, and Bobby had never had a merrier time with her than he had that morning.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22090",NA,"But the prophecy was not fulfilled. Ralph Pullen was by that time in England with his bereaved sister-in-law, and the night arrived without the people in Brussels hearing anything of him. He had not even written a line to account for his failure to keep his engagement with them. The fact is that Captain Pullen, although as a rule most punctilious in all matters of courtesy, felt so ashamed of himself and the folly into which he had been led that he felt that silence would be the best explanation that he had decided to break off the acquaintanceship. He had no real feeling for Harriet Brandt or anybody (except himself)-with him ""out of sight, was out of mind""- and the sad occurrence which had forced him to return to England seemed an excellent opportunity to rid himself of an undesirable entanglement. But Harriet became frantic at the nonfulfilment of his promise. Her strong feelings could not brook delay. She wanted to rush back to Heyst to demand the reason of his defalcation-and in default of that, to write or wire to him at once and ascertain what he intended to do. But the Baroness prevented her doing either. ""Look 'ere, 'Arriet!"" she said to the girl, who was working herself up into a fever, ""it's no use going on like this! 'E'll come or 'e won't come! Most likely you'll see 'im to-morrow or next day, and if not it'll be because 'is sister won't let 'im leave 'er, and the poor young man doesn't know what excuse to make! Couldn't you see 'ow that Doctor Phillips was set against the Captain joining us? 'E went most likely and told Mrs. Pullen, and she 'as dissuaded her brother from coming to Brussels. It's 'ard for a man to go against 'is own relations, you know!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22091",NA,"""But he should have written,"" pleaded Harriet. ""It makes me look a fool!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22092",NA,"""Not a bit of it! Captain Pullen thinks you no fool. 'E's more likely to be thinking 'imself one. And, after all, you know we shall be going back to 'Eyst in a couple more days, and then you can 'ave 'im all to yourself in the evenings and scold 'im to your 'eart's content!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22093",NA,"But the girl was not made of the stuff that is amenable to reason. She pouted and raved and denounced Ralph Pullen like a fury, declaring she would not speak to him when they met again,-yet lay awake at night all the same, wondering what had detained him from her side, and longing with the fierceness of a tigress for blood, to feel his lips against her own and to hear him say that he adored her. Bobby Bates stood by during this tempestuous time, very sorrowful and rather perplexed. He was not admitted to the confidence of his mother and her young friend, so that he did not quite understand why Harriet Brandt should have so suddenly changed from gay to grave just because Captain Pullen was unable to keep his promise to join them at Brussels. He had so enjoyed her company thitherto and she had seemed to enjoy his, but now she bore the gloomiest face possible and it was no pleasure to go out with her at all.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22094",NA,"He wondered if all girls were so-as capricious and changeable! Bobby had not seen much of women. He had been kept in the schoolroom for the better part of his life, and his Mamma had not impressed him with a great admiration for the sex. So naturally he thought Harriet Brandt to be the most charming and beautiful creature he had ever seen, though he was too shy to whisper the truth, even to himself. He tried to bring back the smiles to her face in his boyish way, and the gift of an abnormally large and long sucre de pomme[110] really did achieve that object better than anything else. But the defalcation of Captain Pullen made them all lose their interest in Brussels and they returned to Heyst a day sooner than they had intended.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22095",NA,"As the train neared the station Harriet's forgotten smiles began to dimple her face again, and she peered eagerly from the windows of the carriage as if she expected Ralph Pullen to be on the platform to meet them. But from end to end she saw only cinders, Flemish country women with huge baskets of fish or poultry on their arms, priests in their soutanes and broad-brimmed hats, and Belgians chattering and screaming to each other and their children as they crossed the line. Still, she alighted with her party, expectant and happy, and traversed the little distance between the entrept and the Hotel far quicker than the Baroness and her husband could keep up with her. She rushed into the balcony and almost fell into the arms of the proprietaire Madame Lamont.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22096",NA,"""Ah! Mademoiselle!"" she cried, ""welcome back to Heyst, but have you heard the desolating news?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22097",NA,"""What news?"" exclaimed Harriet with staring eyes and a blanched cheek.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22098",NA,"""Why! that the English lady, cette Madame, si tranquille, si charmante, lost her dear bébé the very day that Mademoiselle and Madame la Baronne left the Hotel!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22099",NA,"""Lost,"" repeated Harriet, ""do you mean that the child is dead?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22100",NA,"""Ah! yes, I do indeed,"" replied Madame Lamont, ""the dear bébé was taken with a fit whilst they were all at dinner, and never recovered again. C'était une perte irréparable![111] Madame was like a creature distracted whilst she remained here!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22101",NA,"""Where is she then? Where has she gone?"" cried Harriet, excitedly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22102",NA,"""Ah! that I cannot tell Mademoiselle. The dear bébé was taken away to England to be buried. Madame Pullen and Mademoiselle Leyton and Monsieur Phillippe and le beau Capitaine all left Heyst on the following day, that is Wednesday, and went to Ostende to take the boat for Dover. I know no more!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22103",NA,"""Captain Pullen has gone away-he is not here?"" exclaimed Miss Brandt, betraying herself in her disappointment. ""O! I don't believe it! It cannot be true! He has gone to Ostende to see them on board the steamer, but he will return-I am sure he will?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22104",NA,"Madame Lamont shrugged her shoulders.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22105",NA,"""Monsieur paid everything before he went and gave douceurs to all the servants-I do not think he has any intention of returning!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22106",NA,"At that juncture, the Baron and Baroness reached the hotel. Harriet flew to her friend for consolation. ""I cannot believe what Madame Lamont says,"" she exclaimed; ""she declares that they are all gone for good, Mrs. Pullen and Miss Leyton and Captain Pullen and the doctor! They have returned to England. But he is sure to come back, isn't he? After all his promises to meet us in Brussels! He couldn't be so mean as to run off to England without a word or a line unless he intended to come back.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22107",NA,"She clung to Madame Gobelli with her eyes wide open and her large mouth trembling with agitation, until even the coarse fibre of the Baroness's propriety made her feel ashamed of the exhibition.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22108",NA,"""'Old up, 'Arriet!"" she said, ""you don't want the 'ole 'ouse to 'ear what you're thinking of, surely! Let me speak to Madame Lamont! What is all the row about, Madame?"" she continued, turning to the proprietaire.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22109",NA,"""There is no 'row' at all, Madame,"" was the reply, ""I was only telling Mademoiselle Brandt of the sad event that has taken place here during your absence-that that chère Madame Pullen had the great misfortune to lose her sweet bébé, the very day you left Heyst, and that the whole party have quitted in consequence and crossed to England. I thought since Mademoiselle seemed so intimate with Madame Pullen and so fond of the dear child that she would be désolée to hear the sad news, but she appears to have forgotten all about it in her grief at hearing that the beau Capitaine accompanied his family to England where they go to bury the petite.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22110",NA,"And with rather a contemptuous smile upon her face, Madame Lamont re-entered the salle à manger.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22111",NA,"""Now, 'Arriet, don't make a fool of yourself!"" said the Baroness. ""You 'eard what that woman said-she's laughing at you and your Captain, and the story will be all over the Hotel in half an hour. Don't make any more fuss about it! If 'e's gone, crying won't bring 'im back. It's much 'arder for Mrs. Pullen, losing her baby so suddenly! I'm sorry for 'er, poor woman, but as for the other, there's as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22112",NA,"But Harriet Brandt only answered her appeal by rushing away down the corridor and up the staircase to her bedroom like a whirlwind. The girl had not the slightest control over her passions. She would listen to no persuasion and argument only drove her mad. She tumbled headlong up the stairs and dashing into her room, which had been reserved for her, threw herself tumultuously upon the bed. How lonely and horrible the corridor on which her apartment opened seemed. Olga Brimont, Mrs. Pullen, Miss Leyton, and Ralph, all gone! No one to talk to-no one to walk with-except the Baroness and her stupid husband! Of course, this interpreted simply meant that Captain Pullen had left the place without leaving a word behind him, to say the why or wherefore, or hold out any prospect of their meeting again. Of course it was impossible but that they must meet again-they should meet again, Harriet Brandt said to herself between her closed teeth-but meanwhile what a wilderness, what a barren, dreary place this detestable Heyst would seem without him!","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22113",NA,"The girl put her head down on the pillow, and taking the corner of the linen case between her strong white teeth, shook it and bit it as a terrier worries a rat! But that did not relieve her feelings sufficiently and she took to a violent fit of sobbing, hot, angry tears coursing each other down her cheeks until they were blurred and stained, and she lay back upon the pillow utterly exhausted.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22114",NA,"The first dinner bell rang without her taking any notice of it, and the second was just about to sound when there came a low tap at her bed-room door. At first she did not reply, but when it was repeated, though rather timidly, she called out,","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22115",NA,"""Who is it? I am ill. I don't want any dinner! I cannot come down!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22116",NA,"A low voice answered, ""It is I, dear Miss Brandt, Bobby! May I come in? Mamma has sent me to you with a message!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22117",NA,"""Very well! You can enter, but I have a terrible headache!"" said Harriet.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22118",NA,"The door opened softly and the tall lanky form of Bobby Bates crept silently into the room. He held a small bunch of pink roses in his hand, and he advanced to the bedside and laid them without a word on the pillow beside her hot, inflamed cheek. They felt deliciously cool and refreshing. Harriet turned her face towards them, and in doing so met the anxious, perturbed eyes of Bobby.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22119",NA,"""Well!"" she said smiling faintly, ""and what is your Mamma's message?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22120",NA,"""She wishes to know if you are coming down to dinner. It is nearly ready!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22121",NA,"""No! no! I cannot! I am not hungry, and my eyes are painful,"" replied Harriet, turning her face slightly away.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22122",NA,"The lad rose and drew down the blind of her window, through which the setting sun was casting a stream of light, and then captured a flaçon of eau de Cologne from her toilet table, and brought it to her in his hand.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22123",NA,"""May I sit beside you a little while in case you need anything?"" he asked.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22124",NA,"""No! no! Bobby! You will want your dinner, and your Mamma will want you. You had better go down again at once and tell her that if my head is better I will meet her on the Digue this evening!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22125",NA,"""I don't want any dinner, I could not eat it whilst you lie here sick and unhappy. I want to stay, to see if I can help you, or do you any good. I wish-I wish I could!"" murmured the lad.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22126",NA,"""Your roses have done me good already,"" replied Harriet more brightly. ""It was sweet of you to bring them to me, Bobby.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22127",NA,"""I wish I had ten thousand pounds a year,"" said Bobby feverishly, ""that I might bring you roses, and everything that you like best!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22128",NA,"He laid his blonde head on the pillow by the side of hers and Harriet turned her face to his and kissed him.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22129",NA,"The blood rushed into his face and he trembled. It was the first time that any woman had kissed him. And all the feelings of his manhood rushed forth in a body to greet the creature who had awakened them.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22130",NA,"As for Harriet Brandt, the boy's evident admiration flattered and pleased her. The tigress deprived of blood will sometimes condescend to milder food. And the feelings with which she regarded Captain Pullen were such as could be easily replaced by anyone who evinced the same reciprocity. Bobby Bates was not a beau sabreur,[112] but he was a male creature whom she had vanquished by her charms and it interested her to watch his rising passion, and to know that he could never possibly expect it to be requited. She kissed and fondled him as he sat beside her with his head on the pillow-calling him every nice name she could think of, and caressing him as if he had been what the Baroness chose to consider him-a child of ten years old.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22131",NA,"His sympathy and entreaties that she would make an effort to join them on the Digue, added to his love-lorn eyes the clear childish blue of which was already becoming blurred with the heat of passion, convinced her that all was not lost, although Ralph Pullen had been ungrateful and impolite enough to leave Heyst without sending her notice, and presently she persuaded the lad to go down to his dinner and inform the Baroness that she had ordered a cup of tea to be sent up to her bedroom, and would try to rise after she had taken it and join them on the Digue.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22132",NA,"""But you will keep a look-out for me, Bobby, won't you?"" she said in parting. ""You will not let me miss your party, or I shall feel so lonely that I shall come straight back to bed!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22133",NA,"""Miss you! as if I would!"" exclaimed the boy fervently, ""why! I shall not stir from the balcony until you appear! O! Miss Brandt! I love you so. You cannot tell-you will never know-but you seem like part of my life!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22134",NA,"""Silly boy!"" replied Harriet, reproachfully, as she gave him another kiss. ""There, run away at once and don't tell your mother what we've been about or she will never let me speak to you again.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22135",NA,"Bobby's eyes answered for him, that he would be torn to pieces before he let their precious secret out of his grasp, as he took his unwilling way down to the table d'hte.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22136",NA,"""Well! you 'ave made a little fool of yourself, and no mistake,"" was the Baroness's greeting, as Harriet joined her in the balcony an hour later, ""and a nice lot of lies I've 'ad to tell about you to Mrs. Montague and the rest. But luckily they're all so full of the poor child's death, and the coffin of white cloth studded with silver nails that was brought from Bruges to carry the body to England in, that they 'ad no time to spare for your tantrums. Lor! that poor young man must 'ave 'ad enough to do, I can tell you, from all accounts, without writing to you! Everything was on 'is 'ands, for Mrs. Pullen wouldn't let the doctor out of 'er sight! 'E 'ad to fly off to Bruges to get the coffin and to wire half over the world besides 'aving the two women to tow about, so you mustn't be 'ard on 'im. 'E'll write soon and explain everything, you may make sure of that, and if 'e don't, why, we shall be after 'im before long! Aldershot, where the Limerick Rangers are quartered, is within a stone's throw of London, and Lord Menzies and Mr. Nalgett often run over to the Red 'Ouse and so can Captain Pullen if he chooses! So you just make yourself 'appy and it will be all right before long.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22137",NA,"""O! I'm all right!"" cried Harriet, gaily, ""I was only a little startled at the news, so would anyone have been. Come along, Bobby! Let us walk over the dunes to the next town. This cool air will do my head good. Good-bye, Baroness! You needn't expect us till you see us! Bobby and I are going for a good long walk!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22138",NA,"And tucking the lad's arm under her own, she walked off at a tremendous pace, and the pair were soon lost to view.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22139",NA,"""I wish that Bobby was a few years older,"" remarked the Baroness thoughtfully to her husband, as they were left alone. ""She wouldn't 'ave made a bad match for him, for she 'as a tidy little fortune and it's all in Consols. But perhaps it's just as well there's no chance of it! She ain't got much 'eart-I couldn't 'ave believed that she'd receive the news of that poor baby's death without a tear or so much as a word of regret, when at one time she 'ad it always in 'er arms. She quite forgot all about it, thinking of the man. Drat the men! They're more trouble than they're worth, but 'e's pretty sure to come after 'er as soon as 'e 'ears she's at the Red 'Ouse!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22140",NA,"""But to what good, mein tear,"" demanded the Baron, ""when you know he is betrothed to Miss Leyton?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22141",NA,"""Yes! and 'e'll marry Miss Leyton, too. 'E's not the sort of man to let the main chance go! And 'Arriet will console 'erself with a better beau. I can read all that without your telling me, Gustave. But Miss Leyton won't get off without a scratch or two, all the same, and that's what I'm aiming at. I'll teach 'er not to call me a female elephant! I've got my knife into that young woman, and I mean to turn it! Confound 'er impudence! What next?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22142",NA,"And having delivered herself of her feelings, the Baroness rose and proceeded to take her evening promenade along the Digue.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22143",NA,"- CHAPTER X -","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22144",NA,"The Red House at Holloway was, like its owner, a contradiction and an anomaly. It had lain for many years in Chancery, neglected and uncared-for, and the Baroness had purchased it for a song. She was very fond of driving bargains, and sometimes she was horribly taken in. She had been known to buy a house for two thousand pounds for a mere caprice and exchange it, six months afterwards, for a dinner service. But as a rule she was too shrewd to be cheated, for her income was not a tenth part of what she represented. When she had concluded her bargain for the Red House, which she did after a single survey of the premises and entered on possession, she found it would take double the sum she had paid to put it into proper repair. It was a very old house of the Georgian era standing in its own grounds of about a couple of acres, and containing thirty rooms full of dust, damp, rats, and decay. The Baroness, however, having sent for a couple of workmen from the firm to put the tangled wilderness which called itself a garden into something like order, sent in all her household gods[113] and settled down there with William and two rough maid servants, as lady of the Manor. The inside of the Red House presented an incongruous appearance. This extraordinary woman, who could not sound her aspirates and could hardly write her own name, had a wonderful taste for old china and pictures and knew a good thing from a bad one. Her drawing-room was heaped with valuables, many of them piled on rickety tables which threatened every minute to overturn them upon the ground. The entrance hall was dingy, bare, and ill-lighted, and the breakfast-room to the side was furnished with the merest necessities. Yet the dressing-table in the Baroness's sleeping apartment was draped in ruby velvet and trimmed with a flounce of the most costly Brussels lace which a Princess might not have been ashamed to wear. The bed was covered with a duvet of the thickest satin, richly embroidered by her own hand, whilst the washing-stand held a set of the commonest and cheapest crockery. Everything about the house was on the same scale; it looked as though it belonged to people who had fallen from the utmost affluence to the depths of poverty. Harriet Brandt was terribly disappointed when she entered it, Bobby's accounts of the magnificence of his home having led her to expect nothing short of a palace.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22145",NA,"The Baroness had insisted on her accompanying them to England. She had taken one of her violent fancies to the girl and nothing would satisfy her but that Harriet should go back with her husband and herself to the Red House, and stay there as long as she chose.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22146",NA,"""Now look 'ere,"" she said in her rough way, ""you must make the Red 'Ouse your 'ome. Liberty 'All, as I call it! Get up and go to bed; go out and come in, just when you see fit-do what you like, see what you like, and invite your friends as if the 'ouse was your own. The Baron and I are often 'alf the day at the boot shop, but that need make no difference to you. I daresay you'll find some way to amuse yourself. You're the daughter of the 'ouse remember, and free to do as you choose!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22147",NA,"Harriet gladly accepted the offer. She had no friends of her own to go to and the prospect of living by herself in an unknown city was rather lonely. She was full of anticipation also that, by means of the Red House and the Baroness's influence, she would soon hear of, or see, Captain Pullen again-full of hope that Madame Gobelli would write to the young man and force him to fulfil the promises he had made to her. She did not want to know Prince Adalbert or Prince Loris-at the present moment it was Ralph and Ralph only, and none other would fill the void she felt at losing him. She was sure there must be some great mistake at the bottom of his strange silence, and that they had but to meet to see it rectified. She was only too glad then, when the day for their departure from Heyst arrived. Most of the English party had left the Lion d'Or by that time. The death of Mrs. Pullen's child seemed to have frightened them away. Some became nervous lest little Ethel had inhaled poisonous vapours from the drainage-others thought that the atmosphere was unhealthy, or that it was getting too late in the year for the seaside, and so the visitors dwindled until the Baroness Gobelli found they were left alone with foreigners and elected to return to England in consequence.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22148",NA,"Harriet had wished to write to Captain Pullen and ask for an explanation of his conduct but the Baroness conjured her not to do so, even threatened to withdraw her friendship if the girl went against her advice. The probabilities were, she said, that the young man was staying with his sister-in-law wherever she might be, and that the letter would be forwarded to him from the Camp and fall into the hands of Mrs. Pullen or Miss Leyton. She assured Harriet that it would be safer to wait until she had ascertained his address and was sure that any communication would reach him at first hand.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22149",NA,"""A man's never the worse for being let alone, 'Arriet,"" she said. ""Don't let 'im think 'e's of too much consequence and 'e'll value you all the more! Our fellows don't care for the bird that walks up to the gun. A little 'olesome indifference will do my gentleman all the good in the world!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22150",NA,"""O! but how can I be indifferent when I am burning to see him again, and to hear why he never wrote to say that he could not come to Brussels,"" exclaimed Harriet, excitedly. ""Do you think it was all false-hoods, Madame Gobelli? Do you think that he does not want to see me any more?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22151",NA,"Her eyes were flashing like diamonds-her cheeks and hands were burning hot. The Baroness chuckled over her ardour and anxiety.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22152",NA,"""He! he! he! you little fool, no, I don't! Anyone could see with 'alf an eye, that he took a fancy for you! You're the sort of stuff to stir up a man and make 'im forget everything but yourself. Now don't you worry. 'E'll be at the Red 'Ouse like a shot, as soon as 'e 'ears we're back in London. Mark my words! it won't be long before we 'ave the 'ole lot of 'em down on us, like bees 'umming round a flower pot.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22153",NA,"After this flattering tale, it was disheartening to arrive in town on a chilly September day, under a pouring rain, and to see the desolate appearance presented by the Red House.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22154",NA,"It was seven in the evening before they reached Holloway and drove up the dark carriage drive, clumped by laurels, to the hall door.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22155",NA,"After the grand description given by Bobby of his Mamma's barouche lined with olive green satin, Harriet was rather astonished that they should have to charter cabs from the Victoria Station to Holloway instead of being met by the Baroness's private carriage. But she discovered after-wards that though there was a barouche standing in the coach-house, which had been purchased in a moment of reckless extravagance by Madame Gobelli, there were no horses to draw it, and the only vehicle kept by the Baroness was a very much patched, not to say disreputable looking Victoria, with a spavined cob attached to it in which William drove the mistress when she visited the boot premises.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22156",NA,"The chain having been taken down, the hall door was opened to them by a slight, timid looking person who Harriet mistook for an upper housemaid.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22157",NA,"""Well, Miss Wynward,"" exclaimed the Baroness, as she stumped into the hall, ""'ere we are, you see!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22158",NA,"""Yes! my lady,"" said the person she addressed, ""but I thought, from not hearing again, that you would travel by the night boat! Your rooms are ready,"" she hastened to add, ""only-dinner, you see! I had no orders about it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22159",NA,"""That doesn't signify,"" interrupted the Baroness, ""send out for a steak and give us some supper instead! 'Ere William, where are you? Take my bag and Miss Brandt's up to our rooms, and Gustave, you can carry the wraps! Where's that devil Bobby? Come 'ere at once and make yourself useful! What are you standing there staring at 'Arriet for? Don't you see Miss Wynward? Go and say ''ow d'ye do' to 'er?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22160",NA,"Bobby started, and crossing to where Miss Wynward stood, held out his hand. She shook it warmly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22161",NA,"""How are you, Bobby?"" she said. ""You don't look much stronger for your trip. I expected to see you come back with a colour!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22162",NA,"""Nonsense!"" commenced the Baroness testily, ""what rubbish you old maids do talk! What should you know about boys? 'Ow many 'ave you got? 'Ere, why don't you kiss 'im? You've smacked 'im often enough, I know!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22163",NA,"Miss Wynward tried to pass the coarse rejoinder off as a joke but it was with a very plaintive smile that she replied, ""I think Bobby is growing rather too tall to be kissed, and he thinks so too, don't you Bobby?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22164",NA,"Bobby was about to make some silly reply when his Mamma inter-rupted him, ""O! does he? 'E'll be wanting to kiss the gals soon, so 'e may as well practise on you first! Come! Bobby, do you 'ear what I say? Kiss 'er!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22165",NA,"But Miss Wynward drew up her spare figure with dignity.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22166",NA,"""No! my lady!"" she said quietly, ""I do not wish it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22167",NA,"""He! he! he!"" giggled the Baroness, as she commenced to mount the stairs, ""'e ain't old enough for you, that's what's the matter! Come along, 'Arriet, my dear! I'm dog-tired and I daresay you're much the same! Let us 'ave some 'ot water to our rooms, Miss Wynward!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22168",NA,"Harriet Brandt was now ushered by her hostess into a bedroom on the same floor as her own, and left to unpack her bundles and boxes as she best might. It was not a badly furnished room but there was too much pomp and too little comfort in it. The mantelshelf was ornamented with some rare old Chelsea figures, and a Venetian glass hung above them, but the carpet was threadbare and the dressing-table was inconveniently small and of painted deal. But as though to atone for these discrepancies, the hangings to the bed were of satin, and the blind that shaded the window was edged with Neapolitan lace. Harriet had not been used to luxuries in the Convent, but her rooms in the Lion d'Or had been amply provided with all she could need and she was a creature of sensual and indolent temperament who felt any rebuff in the way of her comfort terribly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22169",NA,"There was an unhomelike feeling in the Red House and its furniture-and a coldness in their reception which made the passionate, excited creature feel inclined to sit down and burst into tears. She was on the very brink of doing so when a tap sounded on the door and Miss Wynward entered with a zinc can of hot water which she placed on the washing-stand. Then she stood for a moment regarding the girl as though she guessed what was in her mind before she said,","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22170",NA,"""Miss Brandt, I believe! I am so sorry that the Baroness never wrote me with any certainty regarding her arrival, or things would have been more comfortable. I hope you had a good dinner on board!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22171",NA,"""No!"" said Harriet, shaking her head, ""I felt too ill to eat. But it does not signify, thank you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22172",NA,"""But you are looking quite upset! Supper cannot be ready for another hour. I will go and make you a cup of tea!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22173",NA,"She hurried from the room again, and presently returned with a small tray on which was set a Sèvres cup and saucer[114] and Apostle teaspoon,[115] with an earthenware teapot that may possibly have cost sixpence. But Harriet was too grateful for the tea to cavil whence it came, and drinking it refreshed her more than anything else could have done.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22174",NA,"""Thank you, thank you so much,"" she said to Miss Wynward. ""I think the long journey and the boat had been too much for me. I feel much better now!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22175",NA,"""It is such a melancholy house to come to when one is out of sorts,"" observed her companion, ""I have felt that myself! It will not give you a good impression of your first visit to London. Her ladyship wrote me you had just come from the West Indies,"" she added, timidly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22176",NA,"""Yes! I have not long arrived in Europe,"" replied Harriet. ""But I thought-I fancied-the Baroness gave me the idea that the Red House was particularly gay and cheerful, and that so many people visited her here!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22177",NA,"""That is true! A great many people visit here! But-not such people, perhaps, as a young lady would care for!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22178",NA,"""O! I care for every sort,"" said Harriet, more gaily, ""and you,-don't you care for company, Miss Wynward?"" ","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22179",NA,"""I have nothing to do with it, Miss Brandt, beyond seeing that the proper preparations are made for receiving it. I am Bobby's governess, and housekeeper to the Baroness!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22180",NA,"""Bobby is getting rather tall for a governess!"" laughed Harriet.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22181",NA,"""He is, poor boy, but his education is very deficient! He ought to have been sent to school long ago, but her ladyship would not hear of it! But I never teach him now! He is supposed to be finished!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22182",NA,"""Why don't you find another situation then?"" demanded Harriet, who was becoming interested in the ex-governess.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22183",NA,"She was a fragile, melancholy looking woman of perhaps five and thirty who had evidently been good-looking in her day and would have been so then but for her attenuation and shabby dress. But she was evidently a gentlewoman, and far above the menial offices she appeared to fill in the Red House. She gazed at Harriet for a minute in silence after she had put the last question to her, and then answered slowly;","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22184",NA,"""There are reasons which render it unadvisable! But you, Miss Brandt, have you known the Baroness before?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22185",NA,"""I never saw her till we met at Heyst and she invited me here!"" replied the girl.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22186",NA,"""O! why did you come? Why did you come?"" exclaimed Miss Wynward, as she left the room.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22187",NA,"Harriet stood gazing at the door as it closed behind her. Why had she come? What an extraordinary question to ask her! For the same reason that other people accepted invitations from their friends-because she expected to enjoy herself and have the protection of the Baroness on first entering English society! But why should this governess-her dependant, almost her servant-put so strange a question to her? Why had she come? She could not get it out of her mind. She was roused from her train of speculation by hearing the Baroness thumping on the outside panels of her door with her stick.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22188",NA,"""Come along,"" she cried, ""never mind dressing! The supper's ready at last and I'm as 'ungry as an 'unter.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22189",NA,"Hastily completing her toilet, Harriet joined her hostess who conducted her down to a large dining-room wrapt in gloom. The two dozen morocco chairs ranged against the wall looked sepulchral by the light of a single lamp, placed in the centre of a long mahogany table which was graced by the fried steak, a huge piece of cheese, bread and butter, and lettuces from the garden. Harriet regarded the preparations for supper with secret dismay. She was greedy by nature, but it was the love of good feeding rather than a superfluity of food that induced her to be so. However, when the Baron produced a couple of bottles of the very best champagne to add to the meal she felt her appetite somewhat revive and played almost as good a knife and fork as the Baroness. Bobby and Miss Wynward, who as it appeared took her meals with the family, were the only ones who did not do justice to the supper.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22190",NA,"The lad looked worn-out and very pale, but when Miss Wynward suggested that a glass of champagne might do him good, and dispel the exhaustion under which he was evidently labouring, his mother vehemently opposed the idea.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22191",NA,"""Champagne for a child like 'im,"" she cried, ""I never 'eard of such a thing. Do you want to make 'im a drunkard, Miss Wynward? No! thank you, there 'ave been no 'ard drinkers in our family, and 'e shan't begin it! 'Is father was one of the soberest men alive! 'E never took anything stronger than toast and water all the time I knew 'im.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22192",NA,"""Of course not, your ladyship,"" stammered Miss Wynward, who seemed in abject fear of her employer,","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22193",NA,"""I only thought as Bobby seems so very tired, that a little stimulant-""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22194",NA,"""Then let 'im go to bed,"" replied Madame Gobelli. ""Bed is the proper place for boys when they're tired! Come, Sir, off to bed with you at once, and don't let me 'ear anything more of you till tomorrow morning!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22195",NA,"""But mayn't I have some supper?"" pleaded Bobby.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22196",NA,"""Not a bit of it!"" reiterated the Baroness, ""if you're so done up that you require champagne, your stomach can't be in a fit state to digest beef and bread! Be off at once, I say, or you'll get a taste of my stick.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22197",NA,"""But, my lady-"" said Miss Wynward, entreatingly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22198",NA,"""It's not a bit of good, Miss Wynward, I know more about boys' insides than you do. Sleep's the thing for Bobby. Now, no more nonsense, I say-""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22199",NA,"But Bobby, after one long look at Harriet Brandt, had already quitted the room. This episode had the effect of destroying Miss Wynward's appetite. She sat gazing at her plate for a few minutes, and then with some murmured excuse of its being late, she rose and disappeared. The Baron-ess was some time over her meal and Harriet had an opportunity to examine the apartment they sat in, as well as the dim light allowed her to do. The walls were covered with oil paintings and good ones, as she could see at a glance, whilst at the further end, where narrow shelves were fixed from the floor to the ceiling, was displayed the famous dinner service of Sèvres, for which the Baroness was said to have bartered the two thousand lease of her house.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22200",NA,"Harriet glanced from the pictures and the china upon the walls, to the steak and bread and cheese upon the table, and marvelled at the incongruity of the whole establishment. Madame Gobelli who, whilst at the Lion d'Or had appeared to think nothing good enough for her, was now devouring fried steak and onions as if they had been the daintiest of fare. But the champagne made amends, on that night at least, for the solids which accompanied it and the girl was quite ready to believe that the poverty of the table was only due to the fact that they had arrived at the Red House unexpectedly. As they reached the upper corridor her host and hostess parted with her, with much effusion, and passing into their own room, shut the door and locked it noisily. As Harriet gained hers she saw the door opposite partly unclose to display poor Bobby standing there to see her once again.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22201",NA,"He was clothed only in his long night-shirt and looked like a lanky ghost, but he was too childish in mind to think for one moment that his garb was not a suitable one for a lover to accost his mistress in. She heard him whisper her name as she turned the handle of her own door.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22202",NA,"""Why, Bobby,"" she exclaimed, ""not in bed yet?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22203",NA,"""Hush! hush!"" he said in a low voice, ""or Mamma will hear you! I couldn't sleep till I had seen you again and wished you good-night!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22204",NA,"""Poor dear boy! Are you not very hungry?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22205",NA,"""No, thanks. Miss Wynward is very kind to me. She has seen after that. But to leave without a word to you. That was the hard part of it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22206",NA,"""Poor Bobby!"" ejaculated Harriet again, drawing nearer to him. ""But you must not stay out of bed. You will catch your death of cold!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22207",NA,"""Kiss me then and I will go!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22208",NA,"He advanced his face to the opening of the door, and she put her lips to his, and drew his breath away with her own.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22209",NA,"""Good-night! good-night!"" murmured Bobby with a long sigh. ""God bless you! good-night!"" and then he disappeared and Harriet entered her own room, and her eyes gleamed as she recognised the fact that Bobby also was going to make a fool of himself for her sake.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22210",NA,"The next morning she was surprised, on going downstairs at about nine o'clock, to find a cloth laid over only part of the dining table, and breakfast evidently prepared for one person. She was still gazing at it in astonishment, and wondering what it meant, when Miss Wynward entered the room to express a hope that Miss Brandt had slept well and had everything that she required.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22211",NA,"""O! certainly yes! but where are we going to have breakfast?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22212",NA,"""Here, Miss Brandt, if it pleases you. I was just about to ask what you would like for your breakfast.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22213",NA,"""But the Baron and Baroness-""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22214",NA,"""O! they started for the manufactory two hours ago. Her ladyship is a very early riser when at home and they have some four miles to drive.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22215",NA,"""The manufactory!"" echoed Harriet, ""do you mean where they make the boots and shoes?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22216",NA,"""Yes! There is a manufactory in Germany and another in England where the boots and shoes are finished off. And then there is the shop in Oxford Street where they are sold. The Baron's business is a very extensive one!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22217",NA,"""So I have understood, but what good can Madame Gobelli do there? What can a woman know about such things?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22218",NA,"Miss Wynward shrugged her shoulders.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22219",NA,"""She looks after the young women who are employed I believe, and keeps them up to their work. The Baroness is a very clever woman. She knows something about most things-and a good deal that were better left unknown,"" she added, with a sigh.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22220",NA,"""And does she go there every morning?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22221",NA,"""Not always, but as a rule she does. She likes to have a finger in the pie and fancies that nothing can go on properly without her. And she is right so far that she has a much better head for business than the Baron who would like to be out of it all if he could!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22222",NA,"""But why can't he give it up then, since they are so very rich?"" demanded Harriet.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22223",NA,"Miss Wynward regarded her for a moment, as if she wondered who had given her the information, and then said quietly, ""But all this time we are forgetting your breakfast, Miss Brandt! What will you take? An egg, or a piece of bacon?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22224",NA,"""O! I don't care,"" replied Harriet, yawning, ""I never can eat when I am alone! Where is Bobby? Won't he take his breakfast with me?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22225",NA,"""O! he had his long ago with his Mamma, but I daresay he would not mind a second edition, poor boy!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22226",NA,"She walked to the French windows which opened from a rustic porch to the lawn and called ""Bobby! Bobby!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22227",NA,"""Yes, Miss Wynward,"" replied the lad in a more cheerful tone than Harriet remembered to have ever heard him use before, ""what is it?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22228",NA,"""Come in, my dear, and keep Miss Brandt company whilst she takes her breakfast!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22229",NA,"""Won't I!"" cried Bobby, as he came running from the further end of the disorderly garden with a bunch of flowers.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22230",NA,"""They are for you!"" he exclaimed, as he put them into Harriet's hand, ""I gathered them on purpose!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22231",NA,"""Thank you, Bobby,"" she replied. ""It was kind of you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22232",NA,"She felt cheered by the simple attention. For her hostess to have left her on the very first morning without a word of explanation had struck her as looking very much (notwithstanding all the effusive flattery and protestations of attachment with which she had been laden) as if she were not wanted at the Red House.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22233",NA,"But when her morning meal was over, and she had been introduced to every part of the establishment under the chaperonage of Bobby-to the tangled over-grown garden, the empty stables, Papa's library, which was filled with French and German books, and Mamma's drawing-room, which was so full of valuable china that one scarcely dared move freely about it-the burning thirst to see or hear something of Ralph Pullen returned with full force upon Harriet and she enquired eagerly of Miss Wynward when her hostess might be expected to return.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22234",NA,"Miss Wynward looked rather blank as she replied, ""Not till dinner time, I am afraid! I fancy she will find too much to enquire about and to do after so long an absence from home. I am so sorry, Miss Brandt,"" she continued, noting the look of disappointment on the girl's face, ""that her ladyship did not make this plain to you last night. Her injunctions to me were to see that you had everything you required, and to spare no trouble or expense on your account! But that is not like having her here, of course! Have you been into the library? There are some nice English works there, and there is a piano in the drawing-room which you might like to use. I am afraid it is not in tune, on account of the rain we have had and that I have not opened it myself during the Baroness's absence, and indeed it is never used except to teach Bobby his music lessons on, but it may amuse you despite of anything else.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22235",NA,"""O! I daresay I shall find something to amuse myself with,"" replied Harriet rather sullenly. ""I have my own instrument with me, and my books, thank you! But is no one likely to call this afternoon, do you think?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22236",NA,"""This afternoon,"" echoed Miss Wynward, ""are you expecting any of your own friends to see you?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22237",NA,"""O! no! I have no friends in England,-none at least that know I have returned from Heyst. But the Baroness told me-she said the Red House was always full of guests-Prince Adalbert and Prince Loris, and a lot of others-do you think they may come to-day to see her?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22238",NA,"""O! not in September,"" replied her companion, ""it is not the season now, Miss Brandt, and all the fashionable people are out of town at the foreign watering-places or shooting in the country. Her ladyship could never have intended you to understand that the people you have mentioned would come here at any time except between May and July! They do come here then-sometimes-but not, I expect, as you think-not as friends, I mean!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22239",NA,"""Not as friends! What as, then?"" demanded Harriet.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22240",NA,"""Well!"" returned Miss Wynward, dubiously, ""many of them have business with her ladyship and they come to see her upon it! I generally conduct them to her presence and leave them alone with her, but that is all I see of them! They have never come here to a party, or dinner, to my knowledge!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22241",NA,"""How very extraordinary!"" cried Harriet, ""what do they come for then?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22242",NA,"""The Baroness must tell you that!"" replied the other, gravely, ""I am not in her confidence, and if I were I should not feel justified in revealing it.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22243",NA,"This conversation drove Harriet to her room to indite a letter to Captain Pullen. If she were to be deprived of the society of dukes and princes, she would at least secure the company of one person who could make the time pass pleasantly to her. As she wrote to him, rapidly, unadvisedly, passionately, her head burned and her heart was fluttering. She felt as if she had been deceived-cheated-decoyed to the Red House under false pretences, and she was in as much of a rage as her indolent nature would permit her to be. The revelations of Miss Wynward had sunk down into her very soul. No parties, no dinners, with princes handing her into the dining-room and whispering soft nothings into her ears all the time! Why had Madame Gobelli so often promised to console her for the loss of Captain Pullen by this very means and it was a dream, a chimera, they only came to the Red House on business-business, horrid unromantic word-and were shut up with the Baroness. What business, she wondered! Could it be about boots and shoes, and if so, why did they not go to the shop, which surely was the proper place from which to procure them! The idea that she had been deceived in this particular made her write far more warmly and pleadingly perhaps than she would other-wise have done. A bird in the hand was worth two in the bush-Harriet was not conversant with the proverb, but she fully endorsed the senti-ment. When her letter was written and addressed to the Camp at Alder-shot, and she had walked out with Bobby to post it in the pillar box, she felt happier and less resentful. At all events she was her own mistress and could leave the Red House when she chose and take up her abode elsewhere. A hot sun had dried the garden paths and grass, and she spent the rest of the afternoon wandering about the unshaven lawn with Bobby, and lingering on the rotten wooden benches under the trees with the boy's arm round her waist and his head drooping on her shoulder.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22244",NA,"Bobby was blissfully happy and she was content. If we cannot get cavidre[116] it is wise to content ourselves with cod's roe. They spent hours together that afternoon, until the dusk had fallen and the hour of dining had drawn nigh. They talked of Heyst and the pleasures they had left behind them and Harriet was astonished to hear how manly were some of Bobby's ideas and sentiments, when out of sight of his Mamma.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22245",NA,"At last the strident tones of the Baroness's voice were heard echoing through the grounds. Harriet and Bobby leaped to their feet in a moment.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22246",NA,"""'Ere, 'Arriet! Bobby! where are you? You're a nice son and daughter to 'ide away from me when I've been toiling for your benefit all the day.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22247",NA,"She came towards them as she spoke, and when Harriet saw how fatigued she looked, she almost forgave her for leaving her in the lurch as she had done.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22248",NA,"""I suppose you thought we were both dead, didn't you?"" she con-tinued. ""Well, we are, almost. Never 'ad such a day's work in my life! Found everything wrong, of course! You can't turn your back for five minutes but these confounded workmen play old 'Arry with your busi-ness! I sent off ten fellows before I'd been in the factory ten minutes, and fined as many girls, and 'ave been running all over London since to replace 'em. It's 'ard work, I can tell you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22249",NA,"She plumped down upon the rotten seat, nearly bringing it to the ground as she spoke, and burst out laughing.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22250",NA,"""You should 'ave seen one man, you would 'ave died of laughing! 'Get out,' I said to 'im, 'not another day's work do you do 'ere!' 'Get out of the factory where I've worked for twenty years?' 'e said, 'Well, then, I shan't, not for you! If the governor 'ad said so, it might be a different thing, but a woman 'as no right to come interfering in business as she knows nothing about!' 'That's the way the wind lies,' I replied, 'and you want a man to turn you out! We'll soon see if a woman can't do it!' and I took my stick and laid it on his back till he hollored again. He was out of the place before you could say Jack Robinson! ''Ow will that do?' I said to the others, 'who else wants a taste of my stick before 'e'll go!' But they all cleared out before I 'ad done speaking! I laughed till I was ill! But come along children! It's time for dinner!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22251",NA,"As they returned to the house she accosted Harriet, ""I 'ope you've amused yourself to-day! You'll 'ave to look after yourself whenever I'm at the factory! But a 'andsome gal like you won't want long for amusement. We'll 'ave plenty of company 'ere, soon! Miss Wynward,"" she continued, as they entered the dining-room, ""Mr. Milliken is coming to-morrow! See that 'is room is ready for 'im!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22252",NA,"""Very good, my lady!"" replied Miss Wynward, but Harriet fancied she did not like the idea of Mr. Milliken staying with them.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22253",NA,"The dinner proceeded merrily. It was more sumptuous than the day before, consisting of several courses, and the champagne flowed freely. Harriet, sitting at her ease and thoroughly enjoying the repast, thought that it atoned for all the previous inconvenience. But a strange incident occurred before the meal was over. The Baron, who was carver, asked Bobby twice if he would take some roast beef and received no answer, which immediately aroused the indignation of the Baroness.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22254",NA,"""Do you 'ear what your father is saying to you, Bobby?"" she cried, shrilly. ""Answer 'im at once or I'll send you out of the room! Will you 'ave some beef?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22255",NA,"But still there was no reply.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22256",NA,"""My lady! I think that he is ill,"" said Miss Wynward in alarm.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22257",NA,"""Ill! Rubbish!"" exclaimed the Baroness. Being so coarse-fibred and robust a woman herself, she never had any sympathy with delicacy or illness and generally declared all invalids to be humbugs, shamming in order to attract the more attention. She now jumped up from her seat, and going round to her son's chair, shook him violently by the shoulder.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22258",NA,"""'Ere, wake up! what are you about?"" she exclaimed, ""if you don't sit up at once and answer your father's question I'll lay my stick about your back!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22259",NA,"She was going to put her argument into effect when Harriet prevented her.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22260",NA,"""Stop! stop! Madame Gobelli!"" she exclaimed; ""can't you see he has fainted!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22261",NA,"It was really true! Bobby had fainted dead away in his chair, where he lay white as a sheet with closed eyes, and limp body. Miss Wynward flew to her pupil's assistance.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22262",NA,"""Poor dear boy! I was sure he was not well directly he entered the house,"" she said.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22263",NA,"""Not well!"" replied the Baroness, ""nonsense! what should ail 'im? 'Is father was one of the strongest men on God's earth! He never 'ad a day's illness in 'is life. 'Ow should the boy, a great 'ulking fellow like 'im, 'ave got ill?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22264",NA,"She spoke roughly, but there was a tremor in her voice as she uttered the words and she looked at Bobby as though she were afraid of him.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22265",NA,"But as he gradually revived under Miss Wynward's treatment she approached nearer and said with some tenderness in her tones, ""Well! Bobby, lad, and 'ow do you feel now?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22266",NA,"""Better, Mamma, thank you! only my head keeps going round!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22267",NA,"""Had I not better help him up to his bed, my lady?"" asked Miss Wynward.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22268",NA,"""O! yes! but I 'ope 'e isn't going to make a fool of 'imself like this again, for I don't 'old with boys fainting like hysterical gals!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22269",NA,"""I couldn't help it, Mamma!"" said Bobby faintly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22270",NA,"""O! yes! you could, if you 'ad any pluck! You never saw me faint. Nor Gustave either! It's all 'abit! Trundle 'im off to bed, Miss Wynward. The sooner 'e's there, the better!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22271",NA,"""And I may give him a little stimulant,"" suggested Miss Wynward timidly, recalling the scene of the evening before, ""a little champagne or brandy and water-I think he requires it, my lady!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22272",NA,"""O! yes! Coddle 'im to your 'eart's content, only don't let me 'ear of it! I 'ate a fuss! Good-night, Bobby! Mind you're well by tomorrow morning!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22273",NA,"And she brushed the lad's cheek with her bristly chin.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22274",NA,"""Good-night!"" replied Bobby, ""good-night to all!"" as he was supported from the room on the arm of Miss Wynward.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22275",NA,"The Baroness did not make any further remarks concerning her son, but Harriet noticed that her appetite disappeared with him, and declaring that she had tired herself too much to eat, she sat unoccupied and almost silent for the remainder of the meal.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22276",NA,"- CHAPTER XI -","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22277",NA,"Mr. Alexander Milliken arrived punctually upon the morrow.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22278",NA,"He was a tall, gaunt, weak-kneed man, with a prominent nose and eyes that required the constant use of glasses. Harriet Brandt could not at first determine his relationship to the Baroness, who received him with one of the rough kisses she was wont to bestow on Bobby and herself.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22279",NA,"He established himself in the Red House as if he had been a member of the family, and Harriet frequently surprised him engaged in confidential talk with their hostess, which was immediately stopped on her arrival. She perceived that Miss Wynward had an evident dislike for the new-comer and never addressed him but in the most formal manner and when it was strictly necessary. The Baroness did not go so often to the manufactory after Mr. Milliken's arrival, but often shut herself up with him in a room with locked doors, after which Mr. Milliken would be much occupied with secretarial work, writing letters with his short-sighted eyes held close to the paper. He was a source of much curiosity to Harriet Brandt, but he need not have been. He was only that very common and unclean animal-the jackal to Madame Gobelli's lion.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22280",NA,"He was poor and she was rich so he did all the dirty work which she was unable or afraid to do for herself. Mr. Milliken called himself an author and an actor but he was neither. On account of his accidental likeness to a popular actor, he had once been engaged to play the part of his double at a West-end theatre, but with the waning of the piece Mr. Milliken's fame evaporated and he had never obtained an engagement since. His assumed authorship was built on the same scale. He had occasionally penned anonymous articles for newspapers, which had been inserted without pay, but no one in the literary or any other world knew him by name or by fame. Of late he had attached himself to Madame Gobelli, writing her letters for her (of doing which she was almost incapable), and occasionally dabbling in dirtier work which she was too cunning to do for herself. Miss Wynward could have told tales of abusive epistles which had been sent through his hand to people whom the Baroness considered had offended her-of anonymous letters also which, if traced, would have landed them both in the County Court. But Mr. Milliken was out at elbows. He found it very convenient to hang about the Red House for weeks together, to the saving of his pocket-receiving douceurs sometimes in actual coin of the realm at the hands of his benefactress, and making himself useful to her in any way in return. Lately, notwithstanding her grand promises to Harriet Brandt of introductions to lords and princes, the Baroness had thought it would be a very good thing for her favourite jackal if the young heiress took a fancy for him, and gave him full leave in consequence to go in and conquer if he could. She would praise his appearance and his qualities to the girl, before his very face-calling attention to the fact of what a clever creature he was, and what a fine figure he possessed, and how well he was connected, and advising her in her coarse fashion to cultivate his acquaintance better. She even descended to having visions in the broad daylight, and proph-esying the future for them both.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22281",NA,"""'Arriet!"" she would suddenly exclaim, ""I see a man standing be'ind you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22282",NA,"""O! gracious!"" the girl would reply, jumping in her seat, ""I wish you would not say such things, Madame!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22283",NA,"""Rubbish! Why shouldn't I say 'em, if they're there? Stop a bit! Let me see 'im plainly! 'E's got dark 'air, slightly sprinkled with grey-a fine nose-deep-set eyes, with bushy eyebrows-no 'air on 'is face-a tall figure, and long 'ands and feet! 'E's living in this world too! Do you know anybody that answers to the description?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22284",NA,"""No!"" replied the girl, though she recognised it at once as being meant for Mr. Milliken.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22285",NA,"""Well! if you don't know 'im now, you will before long, but it's my belief you've met. And mark my words! you and 'e will be closely con-nected in life! I shouldn't wonder if 'e turns out to be your future 'usband!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22286",NA,"""O! nonsense!"" exclaimed Harriet, trying to speak lightly, ""I'm not going to marry anybody, thank you, Madame Gobelli, unless it's one of the princes you promised to introduce me to.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22287",NA,"""O! princes are all rubbish!"" replied the Baroness, forgetting her former assertions. ""They've none of them got any money, and yours wouldn't go far enough for 'em. They want a gal with something like five thousand a year at 'er back. I'd rather 'ave an Englishman any day, than a dirty little German prince!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22288",NA,"But Harriet Brandt was not the sort of woman to be forced into an intimacy against her will. Born under an hereditary curse, as she un-doubtedly had been, and gifted with the fatal propensity of injuring rather than benefiting those whom she took a fancy for, she was an epicure in her taste for her fellow creatures and would not have permitted Mr. Alexander Milliken to take a liberty with her had he been the last man left upon the earth. She avoided his society as much as it was possible to do, without being rude to her hostess, but as the Baroness was continually calling her to her side, it was difficult to do so. Meanwhile the days went on very differently from what she had anticipated when coming to the Red House. Bobby was languid and indifferent to everything but hanging about the place where she might have located herself-sitting on the sofa beside her, with his heavy head on her shoulder and his weak arm wound about her waist. Miss Wynward feared he must have contracted some species of malaria at the seaside, and Harriet could see for herself that the lad was much altered from the time when they first met-the Baroness alone, either from ignorance or obstinacy, declaring that nothing ailed him but laziness, and she would give him the stick if he didn't exert himself more. Sometimes Harriet took him out with her-for a drive into the country or to a concert or matinée in London, but what was that compared to the entertainment of Royalty and Aristocracy which she had been promised. And she had not heard a word from Captain Pullen, though her first letter of appeal had been succeeded by two or three more. Such a rebuff would have driven another girl to despondency or tears, but that was not the effect it had on Harriet Brandt. If you throw a bone to a tigress and then try to take it away she does not weep-she fights for her prey. Harriet Brandt, deprived of the flatteries and attentions of Captain Pullen did not weep either, but set her pretty teeth together and determined in her own mind that if she were to give him up she would know the reason why. She was reckless-she did not care what she did to obtain it, but she would learn the truth of his defalcation if she travelled down to Aldershot for the purpose. She was in this mood one day when the maid servant who answered the door came to tell her that a lady was in the drawing-room and desired to see her. The Baroness had gone out that afternoon and taken Mr. Milliken with her so that Harriet was alone. She eagerly demanded the name of her visitor.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22289",NA,"""The lady didn't give me her name,"" replied the servant, ""but she asked if Miss Brandt was at home plain enough!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22290",NA,"""Go back and say that I will be with her in a minute!"" said Harriet.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22291",NA,"She had decided in her own mind that the stranger must be Margaret Pullen, bringing her, doubtless, some news of her brother-in-law. She only stayed to smooth her hair which was rather disordered from Bobby laying his head on her shoulder before, with a heightened colour, she entered the drawing-room. What was her surprise to encounter, instead of Mrs. Pullen, Miss Leyton-Miss Leyton who had been so reserved and proud with her at Heyst and who even though she had sought her out at the Red House, looked as reserved and proud as before. Harriet advanced with an extended hand but Elinor Leyton did not appear to see the action as she coldly bowed and sank into her chair again.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22292",NA,"Harriet was rather taken aback but managed to stammer out, ""I am very glad to see you, Miss Leyton! I thought you and Mrs. Pullen had forgotten all about me since leaving Heyst.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22293",NA,"""We had not forgotten, Miss Brandt,"" replied Elinor, ""but we had a great deal of trouble to encounter in the death of Mrs. Pullen's baby, and that put everything else for a while out of our minds. But-but-lately we have had reason to remember your existence more forcibly than before!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22294",NA,"She spoke slowly and with an evident effort. She was as agitated as it was in her nature to be the while but she did not shew it outwardly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22295",NA,"Elinor Leyton had at all times the most perfect command over herself. She was dressed on the present occasion with the utmost neatness and propriety, though she had left her home labouring under a discovery which had pierced her to the very soul. She was a woman who would have died upon the scaffold without evincing the least fear.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22296",NA,"""Reason to remember my existence!"" echoed Harriet, ""I do not understand you.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22297",NA,"""I think you soon will!"" said Elinor, as she took three letters from her handbag and laid them on the table. ""I do not think you can fail to recognise that handwriting, Miss Brandt!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22298",NA,"Harriet stooped down and read the address upon the envelopes. They were her own letters to Captain Pullen.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22299",NA,"""How did you get these?"" she demanded angrily, as she seized them in her hand, ""is thieving one of your proclivities, Miss Leyton?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22300",NA,"""No, Miss Brandt, thieving, as you elegantly put it, is not one of my proclivities! But Captain Pullen has been staying in the house of my father, Lord Walthamstowe at Richmond, and left those letters behind him-thrown in the empty grate just as they are, a proof of how much he valued them! One of the housemaids, whilst setting his room in order after his departure, found them and brought them to me. So I determined that I would return them to your hands myself!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22301",NA,"""And have you read them?"" demanded Harriet.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22302",NA,"""I have read them! I considered it my duty!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22303",NA,"""Your duty!"" replied the other, scornfully, ""what duty is there in a mean, dishonourable action like that? What right had you to interfere with things that don't belong to you? These letters concern myself and Captain Pullen alone!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22304",NA,"""I deny that, Miss Brandt! They concern me quite as much, if not more-Captain Pullen is my affianced husband! We are to be married in the spring!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22305",NA,"""I don't believe it!"" cried Harriet, starting to her feet. ""A woman who would read letters not addressed to her would say anything! You are not engaged to be married to Captain Pullen!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22306",NA,"""Indeed! And on what grounds do you refuse to believe my statement?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22307",NA,"""Because he made love to me all the time he was in Heyst! Because he used to kiss me and tell me again and again that I was the only woman who had ever touched his heart! Because he had arranged to follow the Baroness's party to Brussels only to be near me and he would have done so, had you not prevented him!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22308",NA,"Her great eyes were blazing with indignation and mortified vanity-her slender hands were clenched-she looked as if she were about to spring upon her rival and tear her to pieces-whilst Miss Leyton sat there, calm and collected-and smiled at her ravings.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22309",NA,"""You are quite mistaken,"" she said after a pause, ""I have never mentioned your name to Captain Pullen-I had no idea, until those letters fell into my hands, that he had so far forgotten what he owes to me as to address you in any terms but those of mere acquaintanceship. But now that I do know it must of course be put a stop to at once and for ever! It was to tell you so that I came here this afternoon.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22310",NA,"""Put a stop to! Do you imagine that I am going to give up Captain Pullen at your request? You are vastly mistaken!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22311",NA,"""But you must-you shall!"" exclaimed Elinor, getting (for her) quite excited. ""He is engaged to marry me, and I will not allow him to keep up any communication with you! My decision is final and you will be good enough to respect it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22312",NA,"""Your decision is final!"" cried Harriet in mocking tones. ""O! indeed, is it? And what about Ralph's decision! Does that count for nothing? What if Ralph refuses to give me up?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22313",NA,"Elinor rose to her feet, trembling with indignation at the other's boldness.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22314",NA,"""You shall not call him 'Ralph',"" she exclaimed. ""How dare you speak of a man who is nothing to you in such familiar terms?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22315",NA,"""But is he nothing to me?"" retorted Harriet, ""and am I nothing to him? We must have that question answered first. Ralph told me to call him by his name and he calls me Hally. How can you prevent our doing so? He loves me-he has told me so-and I shall write to him as often as I choose-yes! and I will take him from you, if I choose, and keep him into the bargain! What do you say to that?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22316",NA,"""I say that you are a bold, brazen girl, not fit for me to associate with, and that I refuse to be contaminated by your presence any longer! Let me go!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22317",NA,"She made an effort to gain the door as she spoke, but Harriet barred her exit.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22318",NA,"""No, no, Miss Leyton,"" she said, ""you don't come here to insult me and then leave before you have heard all I have to say to you! In the first place your assurance to-day is the first I ever heard of your being engaged to marry Captain Pullen. He didn't take the trouble to make it public. He never mentioned you except to say what a cold, reserved, unpleasant nature you had and how impossible it would be for a man with any human feeling to get on with you! That is what he thought! And he said it too, when he had his arm round my waist, and his face close to mine. And now he has come to England I suppose he is afraid to carry on with me any more for fear that you should hear of it! But I don't mean to let him off so easily, I can tell you! He shall answer those letters which you say he threw away in the grate, but which you are just as likely to have pilfered from his desk, before he is many days older!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22319",NA,"""You can not make him answer them,"" said Elinor, proudly, ""whatever you may affirm!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22320",NA,"""Not on paper perhaps, but by word of mouth! I will take them back to him at Aldershot and see whether he can deny what I have told when he is face to face with me!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22321",NA,"""Surely!-surely!-you would never proceed to so unmaidenly an extremity,"" exclaimed Elinor, losing sight for a moment of her indignation in her horror at the idea. ""You must not think of such a thing! You would create a scandal in the Camp! You would be despised for it ever after!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22322",NA,"""I can take care of myself!"" replied Harriet, boldly, ""you need not fear for me! And if even you do get your own way about this matter you will have the satisfaction all your married life of knowing that your husband was a coward and a traitor to you, even during your engagement, and that you will never be able to trust him further than you can see him, to the end! If you can care for such a husband, take him, for I'm sure I wouldn't. But he shall answer to me for all that!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22323",NA,"""O! Miss Brandt let me go, pray let me go!"" said Elinor in a tone of such unmistakeable pain that the other involuntarily drew back and let her push her way past her to the door.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22324",NA,"As Miss Leyton disappeared Harriet Brandt commenced to pace up and down the length of the drawing-room. It was not the swaying walk of disappointment and despair; it was determined and masterful, born of anger and a longing for revenge. All the Creole in her came to the surface-like her cruel mother she would have given over Ralph Pullen to the vivisecting laboratory if she could. Her dark eyes rolled in her passion; her slight hands were clenched upon each other; and her crimson lips quivered with the inability to express all she felt. Bobby, glancing in upon her from the French windows which opened on the garden, crept to her side and tried to capture her clenched hands and to keep her restless body still. But she threw him off, almost brutally. At that moment she was brutal.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22325",NA,"""Leave me alone,"" she exclaimed impatiently, ""don't touch me! Go away!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22326",NA,"""O! Hally,"" the boy replied sympathetically, ""what is the matter? Has anyone offended you? Let me know? Let me try to comfort you! Or tell me what I shall do to help you.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22327",NA,"""Do!"" cried the girl contemptuously. ""What could you do?-a baby tied to your mother's apron-string! Leave me to myself, I say! I don't want you or anyone! I want to be alone! Boys are of no use! It requires a man to revenge a woman's wrong!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22328",NA,"The lad, after one long look of bitter disappointment, walked quietly away from the spot and hid his grief in some sequestered part of the garden. Hally despised him-she, who had kissed him and let him lay his head upon her shoulder and tell her all his little troubles-said he was of no use when she stood in need of help and comfort! When, if she only knew it, he was ready to stand up in her defence against twenty men if need be, and felt strong enough to defeat them all! But she had called him a baby, tied to his mother's apron-strings. The iron entered into his very soul.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22329",NA,"Meanwhile Elinor Leyton, having blindly found her way out of the Red House, hailed a passing hansom and gave the driver directions to take her to a certain number in Harley Street where Margaret Pullen was staying with her godfather, Doctor Phillips. She knew no one else to whom she could go in this great trouble which made her feel as if her life had suddenly been cut in two. Yet she made no outward moan. Most young women having kept a bold front as she had done towards the enemy would have broken down as soon as they found themselves alone. But Elinor Leyton was not in the habit of breaking down. As soon as she had started for her destination she leaned her head upon the back of the cab, closed her eyes and set her teeth fast together. Her face grew deadly pale and an observer would have noted the trembling of her lips and the ball which rose and fell in her throat. But she uttered no sound, not even a sigh-her misery was too deep for words.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22330",NA,"Since she had returned to London Margaret Pullen had stayed with Doctor Phillips, for he had insisted that it should be so. The telegram which had conveyed to Colonel Pullen the news of his little daughter's death had been answered by one to say that he had applied for immediate leave and should join his wife as soon as he received it. And Margaret was now expecting his arrival every day-almost every hour. She looked very sad in her deep mourning dress as she came forward to greet Elinor, but as soon as she caught sight of her visitor's face she forgot her own trouble in her womanly sympathy for her friend.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22331",NA,"""My dear Elinor!"" she exclaimed, ""what has brought you to town? You have bad news for me-I can read it in your eyes. Nothing wrong with Ralph, I hope!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22332",NA,"She kissed the girl affectionately and held her hand but Elinor did not answer. She turned her white face towards her friend and bit her lips hard, but the words would not come.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22333",NA,"""You are suffering, my poor dear,"" went on Margaret tenderly, as she made her sit down and removed her hat and cloak. ""Can't you trust me with your trouble? Haven't I had enough of my own? Ah! cry, that's better, God sends us tears in order that our hearts may not break! And now, what is it? Is anyone ill at home?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22334",NA,"Elinor shook her head. The tears were rolling slowly one by one down her marble cheeks, but she jerked them away as they came as though it were a shame to weep.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22335",NA,"After a long pause, she swallowed something in her throat and commenced in a husky voice;","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22336",NA,"""It concerns Ralph, Margaret! He has been untrue to me! All is over between us!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22337",NA,"""O! surely not!"" said Margaret, ""have you had a full explanation with him? Who told you he had been untrue? Has Ralph asked for a release from his engagement?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22338",NA,"""No! but he shall have it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22339",NA,"She then went on to tell the story of the finding of Harriet Brandt's letters in Captain Pullen's grate-and of the interview she had had with the girl that afternoon.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22340",NA,"""She did not attempt to deny it,"" continued Elinor. ""On the contrary, she declared that he had made love to her all the time he was at Heyst-that he had said she was the only woman who had ever touched his heart, and that no man with human feelings could be happy with such a cold, reserved nature as mine! And if you could see her letters to him, Margaret-I wish I had not given them to her, but she snatched them from my hand-they were too dreadful! I never read such letters from a woman to a man. I did not know they could be written.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22341",NA,"""But Elinor, it strikes me that all this time you have only heard one side of the question. What does it signify what Miss Brandt may say? The only thing of importance to you is what Ralph will say.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22342",NA,"""But there were her letters-they told their own story! They were full of nothing but 'dearests' and 'darlings', and reminders of how he had embraced her in one place, and what he had said to her in another-such letters as I could not write to a man if it were to save my life!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22343",NA,"""I can quite understand that! Miss Brandt and you possess two totally different natures. And cannot you understand that a girl like that, half educated, wholly ignorant of the usages of society, with a passionate undeveloped nature and a bold spirit, might write as you have described her doing against the wishes of the recipient of her letters? You say that Ralph threw her epistles in the grate just as they were. Does that look as if he valued them or felt himself to be guilty concerning their reception?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22344",NA,"""But, Margaret, you know he did make himself conspicuous with the Gobellis and Miss Brandt at Heyst! I think everyone noticed their intimacy!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22345",NA,"""I noticed it also and I was very sorry for it but, Elinor, my dear, it was partly your own fault! You were so much opposed to the idea of your engagement to Ralph being made public that I feared it might lead to some contretemps. And then,"" she continued gently, ""don't be offended if I say that your reserve with him, and your objection to anything like love-making on his part, is in itself calculated to drive a young man to society he cares less for!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22346",NA,"""But-but-still-I love him!"" said poor Elinor, with a tremendous effort.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22347",NA,"""I know you do,"" replied Margaret, kissing her again, ""and better and more faithfully perhaps than half the women who show their love so openly-yet men are but men, Elinor, and as a rule they do not believe in the affection which is never expressed by caresses and fond words.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22348",NA,"""Well! whether I have been right or wrong, it is over now,"" said Miss Leyton, ""and Ralph can go to Miss Brandt or anyone else he chooses for amusement. I shall never stand in his way, but I cannot brook an affront, so I shall write and release him from his promise to me at once!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22349",NA,"""No, no, Elinor, you must not do anything so rash! I beg-I implore you, to do nothing until Ralph has had an opportunity of denying the charges brought against him by this girl. They may be utterly untrue! She may be simply persecuting him. Depend upon it, you have only to ask him for an explanation of those letters and everything will be satisfactorily cleared up.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22350",NA,"""You have more belief in him than I have, Margaret! Miss Brandt has great confidence in her cause. She told me that she had not only taken him from me but she meant to keep him, and expressed her intention of going down to Aldershot and confronting Ralph with the letters she had written him!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22351",NA,"At this intelligence, Margaret grew alarmed for her friend's peace of mind.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22352",NA,"""No! no! that must never be,"" she exclaimed, ""that girl must not be permitted to make a scandal in the Camp and get your name perhaps mixed up with it! It must be prevented.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22353",NA,"""I fancy you will find that a difficult task,"" said Elinor, ""she seems the most determined young woman I have ever come across. She became so vehement at last, that she frightened me, and I was only too glad to get out of the house.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22354",NA,"""Elinor,"" said Mrs. Pullen suddenly, ""will you leave this matter in my hands to settle in my own way?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22355",NA,"""What do you intend to do? See Miss Brandt yourself? I advise you not! She will only insult you, as she did me.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22356",NA,"""No! I shall not see her myself, I promise you that, but I will send a proper ambassador to interview Miss Brandt and the Baroness. This sort of thing must not be allowed to go on and unless Ralph comes forward to second the girl's assertions (which I am sure he will never do), she and her friend Madame Gobelli must be made to understand that if they don't behave themselves the law will be called into requisition to enforce obedience. I should not be at all surprised if the Baroness were not at the bottom of all this.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22357",NA,"""At any rate, it has ruined my life!"" said Elinor, mournfully.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22358",NA,"""Nonsense! my dear girl, no such thing! It is only an unpleasant episode which will soon be forgotten. But let it make you a little more careful for the future, Elinor. Ralph is a very conceited man. He has been spoilt by the women all his life, 'pour l'amour de ses beaux yeux.'[117] He has been used to flattery and attention and when he doesn't get it he misses it and goes where it is to be found. It is rather a contemptible weakness but he shares it in common with most of his sex and you have promised, remember, to take him for better or worse!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22359",NA,"""Not yet, thank goodness!"" retorted Elinor, with something of her usual spirit. ""He and father got talking together about the marriage the other day when he was down at Richmond and fixed it, I believe, for the spring, but they will have to unfix it again now, if I am not mistaken.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22360",NA,"""No such thing,"" replied Margaret, ""and now you have consented-have you not?-to leave the settlement of this other affair in my hands.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22361",NA,"""If you wish it, Margaret! But, remember, no compromise! If Ralph has really promised this girl what she says let him keep his promises for I will have none of him. And now I must go home or they will wonder what has become of me!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22362",NA,"Margaret was not sorry to see her depart, for she was most anxious to summon Anthony Pennell, her husband's cousin, to her aid and ask his advice as to what was best to be done in the circumstances.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22363",NA,"She had great faith in Anthony Pennell, not only in his genius which was an accepted thing, but in his good sense which is not usually found associated with the higher quality. He was a man of about thirty, with a grand intellect-a sound understanding-a liberal mind, and a sympa-thetic disposition. He had been originally intended for the Bar, but having ""taken silk"" and made a most promising debut, he had suddenly blossom-ed into an author and his first novel had taken London by storm. He had accomplished the rare feat of being lifted up at once on the waves of public opinion and carried over the heads of all his fellows.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22364",NA,"Since his first success he had continued writing-had given up the law in consequence-and was now making a large and steady income.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22365",NA,"But Anthony Pennell's great charm lay in his unassuming manner and modest judgment of his own work. His triumphs were much more astonishing to him than to his friends. In person he was less handsome than his cousin Ralph Pullen but much more manly looking, having been a distinguished athlete in his College days, and still finding his best recreation on the cricket field and the golf ground. He was very fair, with a white skin, embrowned here and there by sun and out door exercise-short, curly hair-a fine figure, standing six foot high and the bluest of blue eyes. He was smoking in his own chambers late that afternoon, when he received a telegram from Margaret Pullen, ""Can you come over this evening?"" and as soon as he had changed his lounging coat he obeyed her summons.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22366",NA,"- CHAPTER XII -","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22367",NA,"Anthony Pennell was a very fresh, pleasant and good-looking pre-sentment of a young English gentleman as he entered the room where Margaret was sitting with Doctor Phillips that evening. It had been arranged between them beforehand that as little as need be should be confided to him of Harriet Brandt's former history. All that was necessary for him to know was the danger that threatened to blast the future happiness of Ralph Pullen and Elinor Leyton.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22368",NA,"""Well! Mrs. Pullen,"" he said, as he shook hands cordially with Margaret and the doctor, ""and what important business is it that you want to consult me upon? I thought, at the very least, that I should meet my cousin Arthur here!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22369",NA,"""If I had had Arthur, perhaps I should not have needed you,"" replied Margaret, with a faint smile. ""But really Mr. Pennell, I am in want of advice sorely, and the Doctor agreed with me that you would be the best person to whom I could apply!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22370",NA,"""I am at your service, Madam!"" said the young man, gaily, as he seated himself.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22371",NA,"Then she told him the story of Harriet Brandt-how Ralph had met her at the Lion d'Or and devoted his time to her-and how she was persecuting him with letters and had threatened to follow him to the Camp and interview him there.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22372",NA,"""And it must be put a stop to, you know, Mr. Pennell,"" she concluded, ""not only for Ralph's sake and Elinor's, but for the sake of the Waltham-stowes and my husband. I am sure that Arthur would be exceedingly annoyed at any scandal of that sort, and especially as Lord Walthamstowe is so old a friend of his family!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22373",NA,"Anthony Pennell had looked very grave during her recital. After a pause he said, ""Are you sure that Ralph has not given this young lady good cause to run after him?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22374",NA,"""I think not-I hope not! There was very little amusement in Heyst, and this girl and the people with whom she is now staying-a Baron and Baroness Gobelli they call themselves-were amongst the visitors to the Lion d'Or. Miss Leyton is rather a stickler for the proprieties and used to refuse to walk out with Ralph alone in the evenings, and I was too much occupied with my poor darling baby to accompany them,"" said Margaret in a faltering voice. ""So Ralph took to going to the Baroness's private rooms instead and became intimate with Miss Brandt!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22375",NA,"""You acknowledge then, that he was intimate with her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22376",NA,"""I think he must have been-because it appears that he had agreed to join their party at Brussels when-when-my great trouble obliged him to return to England with us instead.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22377",NA,"""Did you know this young lady, Mrs. Pullen?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22378",NA,"""I did, and at one time I was rather intimate with her, that is, before the Baroness took her up, when she passed almost all her time with them.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22379",NA,"""She is, I suppose, very attractive in person?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22380",NA,"""O! dear no, not at all!"" cried Margaret, with a woman's dull appre-ciation of the charms of one of her own sex, ""she has fine eyes and what men would, I suppose, call a good figure, but no complexion and an enormous mouth. Not at all pretty, but nice-looking at times-that is all!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22381",NA,"""Clever?"" said Pennell, interrogatively.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22382",NA,"""I do not think so! She had just come out of a Convent school and was utterly unused to society. But she has a very good voice and plays well on the mandoline!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22383",NA,"""Ladies are not always the best judges of their own sex,"" remarked Anthony turning to Doctor Phillips, ""what do you say, Doctor? Had you an opportunity of appraising Miss Brandt's beauties and accomplishments for yourself?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22384",NA,"""I would rather say nothing, Mr. Pennell,"" replied the Doctor. ""The fact is, I knew her parents in the West Indies and could never believe in anything good coming from such a stock. Whatever the girl may be, she inherits terrible proclivities, added to black blood. She is in point of fact a quadroon and not fit to marry into any decent English family!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22385",NA,"""O! dear!"" exclaimed Mr. Pennell laconically,","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22386",NA,"""And how do you expect me to help you?"" he enquired, after a pause.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22387",NA,"""I want you to see the Baroness, or Miss Brandt, and tell them that this girl must cease all communication with Captain Pullen,"" said Margaret, ""tell them that he is engaged to marry Miss Leyton-that the marriage is fixed to take place next spring and that the Walthamstowe family will be excessively annoyed if any scandal of this sort occurs to break it off.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22388",NA,"""Do they not know that such an engagement exists?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22389",NA,"""No! that is the unfortunate part of it! Elinor Leyton is so absurdly scrupulous that she will not have the fact made public and forbade me to tell Miss Brandt about it! Elinor went to the Red House where Miss Brandt is staying this morning and had a most stormy interview with her. She came here afterwards in a most distressed state of mind. Harriet Brandt had told her that she had secured Ralph Pullen and meant to keep him-that he had told her he loved her-and that Miss Leyton was too cold and prudish a nature for any man to be happy with! Of course Elinor was terribly upset. She seldom shews her feelings but it was quite impossible for her to disguise them today. I begged her to leave the matter in my hands and she consented to do so. That is why I telegraphed for you.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22390",NA,"""It is rather an awkward predicament!"" said Anthony Pennell thoughtfully, ""you will forgive me for saying, Mrs. Pullen, that Ralph is so very likely to have done this sort of thing that I feel one might be treading on very delicate ground-in fact, putting one's foot in it-by interfering. You know what Ralph is-selfish and indolent and full of vanity. He considers it far too much trouble to make love (as it is called) to a woman but he will accept any amount of love that is offered him so long as it gives him no trouble. If this Miss Brandt is all that you and the doctor here say of her, she may possibly have drawn Ralph on and taken his languid satisfaction as proof that he agreed to all she said and did. But it will make the dénouement just as unpleasant. Besides, how will Ralph himself take my interference in the matter? He may have some designs on this girl-some ideas in the future connected with her-and will ask what business I had to come between them.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22391",NA,"""O! no! Did I not tell you that he had left her letters in his grate?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22392",NA,"""That might be part of his indolent carelessness, or they may have been left there by design, as a means of breaking the ice between himself and Miss Leyton. Is not he, after all, the most proper person to appeal to? Why not wait till your husband returns and let him speak to his brother?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22393",NA,"""I am so afraid in that case that Ralph might consider that he had gone too far with Miss Brandt, and honour demanded that he should marry her! And, Mr. Pennell, Doctor Phillips could tell you things, if he chose, to prove to you that Harriet Brandt is not a fit wife for any decent man.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22394",NA,"Anthony Pennell thought again for a few minutes-sitting silent with his hand caressing his smooth chin. Then he said:","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22395",NA,"""If you are very much bent on my doing what I can in this matter, I see only one way to accomplish it. I must enter the Red House under a flag of truce. Did you know this Baroness Gobelli? Can you tell me what sort of woman she is? I never heard the name before!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22396",NA,"""She is quite a character,"" replied Margaret, ""I believe her husband is a German Baron, but she was a Mrs. Bates and is an extraordinary Baron-ess. A strange mixture also of vulgarity and refined tastes. She drops all her aspirates yet talks familiarly of aristocratic and royal titles, she dresses like a cook out on Sundays and yet has a passion for good paintings and old china.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22397",NA,"At the last words, Anthony Pennell pricked up his ears.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22398",NA,"""A passion for old china!"" he exclaimed, ""then there must be some good in her! Cannot you give me an introduction to the Red House on the plea that I am a connoisseur and am desirous of seeing her collection?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22399",NA,"""Of course I can, but how can you approach these people in amity with a censure of Miss Brandt's conduct in your hand? Madame Gobelli is infatuated with Harriet Brandt! I was telling poor Elinor only this after-noon that I should not be at all surprised if she were at the bottom of all this unpleasantness.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22400",NA,"""She could not be at the bottom of anything unless Ralph had given her cause,"" replied Mr. Pennell, who had never had a good opinion of his cousin's straightforward dealing, ""and however it may turn out I should think he would have a heavy reckoning to settle with Miss Leyton! This is not the first time remember! You have not forgotten the trouble Arthur had to get him out of that scrape with the laundress's girl at Aldershot the year before last!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22401",NA,"""Yes! Arthur told me about it,"" replied Margaret. ""But you are going to help us this time, Mr. Pennell, are you not?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22402",NA,"""In so far as procuring an introduction to the Baroness and taking my opportunity to let her know the true state of affairs with Miss Leyton, yes,"" said Mr. Pennell. ""But there my responsibility must cease. Should Ralph have committed himself in writing, or anything of that sort, you must promise to let them fight it out their own way. I daresay there will be no trouble about the matter. I can see how it has occurred at a glance. Ralph has been merely amusing himself with the girl and she has taken his philandering in earnest. But I wish he would leave that sort of thing off. It will ruin his married life if he does not!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22403",NA,"""Yes! indeed, and Elinor Leyton really loves him, more, I am sure, than he imagines. She declared this afternoon that if it were not put a complete stop to she should break off her engagement. And I think she would be right!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22404",NA,"""So do I,"" acquiesced Anthony Pennell. ""Well! if these people are ordinarily decent they will, as soon as they hear the truth, prevent their young friend interfering with another woman's rights. Write me the introduction, Mrs. Pullen, and I will pay the Red House a visit as soon as its owner gives me leave. And now let us talk of something pleasanter. How soon do you expect Arthur to arrive?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22405",NA,"""Any day,"" replied Margaret, ""and I am longing so for him to come!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22406",NA,"""Of course you are! Will he remain long in England?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22407",NA,"""Only a few weeks! He has taken three months' leave. Then, I shall return with him to Hoosur.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22408",NA,"""And you like the idea of India?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22409",NA,"""O! anything-anything-to find myself with him again,"" she answered feverishly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22410",NA,"The conversation turned upon more indifferent subjects, and armed with the note of introduction to the Baroness, Anthony Pennell presently took his leave. He did not like the task imposed upon him, and he hardly knew how he should set about it, but on consideration he thought he could do no harm by having a look at the young lady who had taken the fancy of his fickle-minded cousin Ralph, and leaving his future action to be decided by the interview. He sat down therefore before turning into bed and wrote a note to the Baroness enclosing the introduction from Mrs. Pullen, and asking permission to call and inspect her rare collection of china, of which he had heard so much.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22411",NA,"His letter reached the Red House on the following morning, at an unfortunate moment, when Madame Gobelli was giving full display to the worst side of her eccentric character.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22412",NA,"The Baroness was not a lover of animals, either dogs or horses. She was merciless to the latter and the former she kicked whenever they came in her way. It was considered necessary, however for the safety of the Red House, that it should be guarded by a watch-dog and a miserable retriever, which answered to that name, lived in a rotten cask in the stable yard. This unhappy animal, which had neither sufficient food, exercise, nor straw to lie on, was in the habit of keeping up a continuous baying at night in remonstrance at the cruelty of its treatment, which was a cause of annoyance to the neighbours who had often written to the Baroness about it in vain.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22413",NA,"On the morning in question a Captain Hill, who lived on one side the Red House with his parents, sent in his card to Madame Gobelli and asked for an interview. She admitted him at once. She liked men of all sorts and particularly if they were young and she could kiss them with impunity under the pretence that she was old enough to be their mother. She therefore welcomed Captain Hill quite amiably. She came in from the garden to receive him, attired in a Genoa velvet dress that trailed half a yard on the damp ground behind and a coarse Zulu hat perched on her large bullet head. She was attended by Harriet Brandt, who had been making a tour of the premises with her, and was always eager to see anybody who might call at the Red House, Miss Wynward also, who was dusting the china with a feather brush as the visitor was announced, continued her occupation and without apologising for doing so or asking leave.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22414",NA,"Harriet had not yet been able to determine the exact place which this lady held in the Baroness's household, for she was treated as one of the family, and yet degraded at times to the position of a servant.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22415",NA,"The Baroness expected her to cook, or dust rooms, or darn stockings, or do anything required of her, whilst she introduced her to all her friends as if on a perfect equality with themselves. As she entered the drawing-room through one of the French windows she shook hands familiarly with Captain Hill and introduced him to both her companions.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22416",NA,"""Well!"" she went on, ""and so you've come to see us at last! I thought you were going to live and die in that tumble-down old place of yours without so much as a shake of the 'and! I 'ope you're all well at 'ome!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22417",NA,"The stranger did not seem to know how to receive these civilities. He had not seated himself but stood in the centre of the room with his hat in his hand as though he found a difficulty in stating his errand at the Red House.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22418",NA,"""Take a chair,"" said Madame Gobelli in her rough way, ""there's enough and to spare, and my young friend 'ere, won't eat you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22419",NA,"Still Captain Hill deliberated about accepting her offer.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22420",NA,"""Thank you,"" he commenced, ""but I shall not detain you above a few moments. I came to speak to you about your dog, Madame Gobelli. My parents are both very old, and my mother especially delicate-indeed, I fear that she may never rise from her bed again!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22421",NA,"Here his voice faltered a little, but quickly recovering himself he went on, ""She sleeps very little, and that little has now become impossible to her on account of the incessant barking of your yard dog. I am here to-day by the wish of my mother's medical attendant, Doctor Parker, to tell you that the noise is seriously affecting her health, and to beg that you will adopt some measures to have the annoyance stopped.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22422",NA,"As the Baroness understood the reason for which her neighbour had called upon her, her countenance palpably changed. The broad smile faded from her face and was replaced by an ominous frown. If there was one thing which she resented above another, it was being called to task for any disturbance in her household. Without taking any notice apparently of Captain Hill's complaint, she turned to Miss Wynward and said, ""Miss Wynward, come 'ere! Does that dog bark at night?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22423",NA,"""Sometimes, my lady,"" replied the governess dubiously.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22424",NA,"""I don't believe it! You're lying! 'Arriet, does Nelson ever bark so as to disturb anyone?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22425",NA,"""He barks whenever there is a ring at the bell, or a stranger enters the grounds, Madame,"" said Harriet, with politic evasion.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22426",NA,"""O! I assure you he does more than that!"" interposed the visitor, ""the poor animal howls without ceasing. Either he is ill or the servants do not give him sufficient food!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22427",NA,"But at this censure cast upon her domestics, whom she bullied from morning till night, the Baroness's uncontrolled temper burst forth.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22428",NA,"""'Ow dare you come 'ere,"" she exclaimed loudly, ""and bring false accusations against my servants? No one in this 'ouse is kept short of food. What do you mean-a rubbishing fellow like you-by coming 'ere and accusing the Baron of starving 'is animals? There's more money spent upon our animals, I bet, than goes in your poverty-stricken 'ouse-'old in a year!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22429",NA,"Captain Hill was now offended, as he well might be. ""I do not know what knowledge you may possess of the exigencies of my parents' household, Madam,"" he replied, ""but what I came here to tell you is this-that from whatever cause it may arise, the howling and whining of your dog is a public nuisance and it must be stopped!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22430",NA,"""Must, must!"" exclaimed Madame Gobelli, shaking her stick at him, ""and pray 'oo's to make me stop it?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22431",NA,"""I will,"" said Captain Hill, ""the noise is endangering the life of my mother and I shall insist upon the animal being destroyed or taken elsewhere. If you cannot take a friendly hint-if you have so callous a nature that the sufferings of an aged and invalid lady cannot excite your sympathy, the law shall teach you that whatever you may fail to feel, you cannot annoy your neighbours with impunity!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22432",NA,"""Fine neighbours indeed!"" cried the Baroness, her whole face trembling and contorted with passion. ""A beggarly lot of half-pay officers and retired parsons! I'll soon see if you'll be allowed to come riding the 'igh 'orse over me! Confound your impudence! Do you know 'oo I am?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22433",NA,"""A Billingsgate fishwoman, I should imagine, from your language! Certainly not a gentlewoman!"" said Captain Hill, his eyes blazing with his wrath.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22434",NA,"""'Ang you! I'll soon teach you 'ow to insult a lady that's connected with Royalty!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22435",NA,"At that the stranger burst into a derisive laugh.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22436",NA,"""Down the back stairs!"" he muttered to himself, but Madame Gobelli caught the words.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22437",NA,"""Get out of my 'ouse,"" she cried. ""'Ere, Miss Wynward, see this fellow out at the front door and never you let 'im in again or I'll give you a month's warning! Down the back stairs indeed! Confound you! If you don't clear out this very minute, I'll lay my stick across your back! You'll make me destroy my dog will you, and just because your trumpery mother don't like 'is barking! Go 'ome and tell 'er to 'old 'er own row! And you accuse my servants of not giving 'im enough to eat. You'd be glad enough to see 'is dinner on your own table once or twice a week. Out with you, I say-out with you at once, and don't let me see your ugly mug and your carroty 'ead in 'ere again, or I'll set the dog you don't like upon you.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22438",NA,"Captain Hill had turned white as a sheet with anger.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22439",NA,"""You'll hear more of this, Madam, and from my solicitor next time,"" he said. ""Heartless, unfeeling woman! How can you call yourself a mother when you have no pity for a son's grief at his mother's illness? Pray God you may not have occasion to remember this morning when you have to part from your own son!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22440",NA,"He rushed from the room as he spoke and they heard the hall door slam after him. For a minute after he left there was a dead pause between the three women. His last words seemed to have struck the Baroness as with a two-edged sword. She stood silent, staring into vacancy, and breathing hard, whilst Harriet Brandt and Miss Wynward regarded each other with furtive dismay. The silence was broken by Madame Gobelli bursting into a harsh laugh.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22441",NA,"""I don't fancy 'e will shew 'is face in my 'ouse again, in an 'urry,"" she exclaimed. ""It was as good as a play to watch 'im, trying to brave it out! Confound 'is old mother! Why don't she die and 'ave done with it! I've no patience with old people 'anging on in that way, and worrying the 'ole world with their fads! Well! what is it?"" she continued to a maid who brought her a letter.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22442",NA,"""By the post, my lady!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22443",NA,"The Baroness broke the seal. There was such a look of scare upon her features that some people might have thought she was glad to have anything to do that should hide it from her companions. The letter was from Anthony Pennell, whose name was familiar to her as to all the world.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22444",NA,"As she finished its perusal her manner entirely altered. The broad smile broke out on her countenance-her eyes sparkled-one would have thought she could never be in anything but a beaming good temper.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22445",NA,"""'Olloa! 'Arriet!"" she exclaimed, ""'ere's news for you! 'Oo do you think this letter's from?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22446",NA,"""How can I guess?"" replied the girl, though her thoughts had flown at once to Ralph Pullen.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22447",NA,"""From Mr. Anthony Pennell, the great author you know, and own cousin to that rapscallion Captain Pullen! Now we shall 'ear all about the 'andsome Captain! Mr. Pennell says 'e wants to come 'ere and see my china, but I know better! 'E's bringing you a message from 'is cousin, mark my words! I can see it written up be'ind you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22448",NA,"Harriet's delicate face flushed with pleasure at the news.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22449",NA,"""But why shouldn't Captain Pullen have come himself?"" she asked, anxiously.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22450",NA,"""I can't tell you that! Perhaps 'e is coming, be'ind the other and this is only a feeler! There's wheels within wheels in these big families sometimes, you know, and the Pullens are connected with a lot of big-wigs! But we'll 'ave some news, any way! You just sit down my dear, and write Mr. Pennell a pretty note in my name-you write a prettier 'and than I do-and say we shall be very pleased to see 'im to-morrow afternoon, if convenient, and I 'ope 'e will stay to dinner afterwards and be introduced to the Baron-will you?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22451",NA,"""O! yes, of course, Madame, if you wish it!"" replied the girl, smiles dimpling her face at the thought of her triumph over Elinor Leyton.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22452",NA,"""Now, Miss Wynward, we must 'ave a first-rate dinner to-morrow for Mr. Pennell, and you and Bobby 'ad better dine at one o'clock or you'll spoil the table. Let me see! We'll 'ave--""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22453",NA,"But turning to enforce her orders the Baroness discovered that Miss Wynward had quitted the room.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22454",NA,"""Why! where 'as the woman gone? Did you see 'er leave the room, 'Arriet?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22455",NA,"""I did not! I was too much occupied listening to you,"" replied the girl from the table where she was inditing the answer to Anthony Pennell's note.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22456",NA,"""'Ere, Miss Wynward! Miss Wynward!"" screamed the Baroness from the open door, but no reply came to her call.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22457",NA,"""I must go and see after 'er!"" she said, as she stumped from the room, as intent upon procuring a good dinner for one young man as she had been in insulting the other and turning him from her doors.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22458",NA,"Meanwhile Captain Hill, hot and angry, was striding away in the direction of his own home when he heard a soft voice calling his name in the rear. He turned to encounter the spare, humiliated form of Miss Wynward.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22459",NA,"""Captain Hill,"" she ejaculated, ""I beg your pardon, but may I speak to you for a moment?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22460",NA,"Recognising her as having been in the room when the Baroness had so grossly insulted him he waited, rather coldly, for her to come up with him.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22461",NA,"""Don't think me impertinent or interfering,"" faltered Miss Wynward, ""but I was so shocked-so distressed-I could not let you go without saying how grieved and sorry I am!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22462",NA,"""I do not quite understand you,"" replied Captain Hill.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22463",NA,"""O! yes, surely, did you not see me in the room just now! I felt as if I should die of shame! But if you knew what it is to be dependent-to be unable to speak or to expostulate-you would guess perhaps--""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22464",NA,"""Yes! Yes! I think I can understand. But pray don't distress yourself about it! It was my own fault! I should have addressed her first through my solicitor. But I thought she was a gentlewoman!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22465",NA,"""It is her temper that gets the better of her,"" said Miss Wynward in an apologetic tone, ""she is not always so bad as she was this morning!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22466",NA,"""That is fortunate for the world at large,"" replied Captain Hill, gravely. ""I could have forgiven her vulgarity, but not her heartlessness. I can only think that she is a most terrible woman.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22467",NA,"""That is what everybody says,"" answered his companion, ""but she will admit of no remonstrance. She will have her own way and the Baron is as powerless to refrain her as you or I. But that she should so insult a gentleman like yourself, even descending to oaths and personalities-O! I cannot tell you how much I felt it-how ashamed I was and how anxious that you should not confound me with anything the Baroness said or did!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22468",NA,"""Indeed,"" said Captain Hill, holding out his hand, ""you need have no fear on that score. I hope I know a gentlewoman when I see her! But tell me, since your eyes are open to all this, how is it that a lady like yourself can stay under the roof of so terrible a person? There are plenty of other situations to be had! Why do you not leave her and go elsewhere?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22469",NA,"He was struck by the look of mingled anxiety and fear with which she regarded him.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22470",NA,"""O! Captain Hill, there are reasons that are difficult to explain-that I could not tell to anyone on so short an acquaintance. But the Baroness possesses great power-she could ruin me, I believe she could kill me if she chose!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22471",NA,"""She threatens you then!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22472",NA,"""Yes!"" came from Miss Wynward's lips, but in almost a whisper.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22473",NA,"""Well! this is hardly the time and place to discuss such a question,"" said Captain Hill, ""but I should much like to see more of you, Miss Wynward! If you have any time at your disposal, will you come over and see my old mother? She is quite confined to her room but I know it would please her to have a quiet talk with you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22474",NA,"A light glistened in Miss Wynward's washed-out eyes, and a smile stole over her countenance.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22475",NA,"""Do you really mean it, Captain Hill?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22476",NA,"""I never say anything that I do not mean,"" he answered. ""I am sure both my parents would be glad to give you their advice and my dear father, who is a clergyman, though past an active ministry, may be able to be of use to you in a more practical way. At any rate, you will come and see us. That is a bargain!"" and he held out his hand to her again in farewell.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22477",NA,"""O! I will-I will, indeed,"" exclaimed Miss Wynward, gratefully, ""and thank you so very much for the permission. You have put a little hope into my life!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22478",NA,"She seized the hand he proffered her and kissed it, as an inferior might have done, and then hurried back to the Red House before he had had time to remonstrate with her on the proceeding.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22479",NA,"- CHAPTER XIII -","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22480",NA,"When Anthony Pennell received the Baroness's invitation, penned in the delicate foreign handwriting of Harriet Brandt, he accepted it at once. Being out of the season he had no engagement for that evening but he would have broken twenty engagements sooner than miss the chance, so unexpectedly offered him, of meeting in an intimate family circle the girl who appeared to have led his cousin Ralph's fancy astray. He pictured her to himself as a whitey-brown young woman with thick lips and rolling eyes, and how Ralph, who was so daintily particular where the beau sexe was concerned, could have been attracted by such a specimen, puzzled Anthony altogether. The knowledge that she had money struck him unpleasantly, for he could think of no other motive for Captain Pullen having philandered with her as he evidently had done. At any rate, the idea that there was the least chance of allying herself with their family must be put out of her head at once and for ever.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22481",NA,"Mr. Pennell amused himself with thinking of the scare he should create at the dinner table by ""springing"" the news of Ralph's intended marriage upon them all at once. Would the young lady have hysterics he wondered, or faint away, or burst into a passion of tears? He laughed inwardly at the probability! He felt very cruel over it! He had no pity for the poor quadroon, as Doctor Phillips had called her. It was better that she should suffer than that Elinor Leyton should have to break off her engagement. And, by Margaret Pullen's account, Miss Brandt had been both defiant and insulting to Miss Leyton. She must be a brazen, unfeeling sort of girl-it was meet that she paid the penalty of her foolhardiness.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22482",NA,"It was in such a mood that Anthony Pennell arrived at the Red House at five o'clock in the afternoon, that he might have the opportunity to inspect the collection of china that had gained him an entrance there.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22483",NA,"The Baroness had promised to be home in time to receive him, but he was punctual and she was not. Harriet Brandt was loitering about the garden, which was still pleasant enough on fine days in the middle of September, when the news that Mr. Pennell was in the drawing-room was brought to her by Miss Wynward. Harriet had been very eager to meet Anthony Pennell-not because she was pining after his cousin, but because her feminine curiosity was strong to discover why Ralph had deserted her, and if he had been subjected to undue influence to force him to do so. But now that the time had come she felt shy and nervous. Suppose he, Mr. Pennell, had seen Miss Leyton meanwhile, and heard all that had taken place between them when she visited the Red House. And suppose he should take Miss Leyton's part! Harriet's mind was full of ""supposes"" as she turned to Miss Wynward and said, ""O! I can't go and receive him, Miss Wynward! Mr. Pennell has come to see the Baroness, not me! Cannot you entertain him until she comes home? She will not be long now!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22484",NA,"""Her ladyship's last words to me, Miss Brandt, were that if she had not returned from the factory by the time Mr. Pennell arrived you were to receive him and give him afternoon tea in her stead! I hope you will do as her ladyship desired!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22485",NA,"""Well! I suppose I must then,"" replied Harriet, screwing up her mouth with a gesture of dissatisfaction, ""but do send in the tea quickly please!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22486",NA,"""It shall be served, Miss Brandt, as soon as I can get back to make it! Mr. Pennell seems a very pleasant gentleman! I wouldn't mind if I were you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22487",NA,"Miss Wynward hurried back to the house as she spoke, and Harriet walked slowly over the lawn towards the drawing-room windows.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22488",NA,"Anthony Pennell, who had been bending over some rare specimens of old Chelsea, looked up suddenly as she approached and was struck dumb with admiration. She had improved wonderfully in looks since she had been in Europe, though the women who lived with her continually were slow to perceive it. Her delicate complexion had acquired a colour like that of a blush rose which was heightened by contrast with her dark, glowing eyes, whilst her hair, by exposure to the rays of the sun, had caught some of its fire and showed ruddily, here and there, in streaks of auburn. Her figure, without having lost its lissom grace, was somewhat fuller and her manner was altogether more intelligent and less gauche than it had been. But the dark eyes were still looking for their prey and the restless lips were incessantly twitching and moving one over the other. She was beautifully dressed that evening-she had not been in London for a month without finding a way to spend her money-and Anthony Pennell, like most artistic natures, was very open to the influence of dress upon a woman. Harriet wore a frock of the palest lemon colour, cut quite plain, but perfect in every line and pleat and fold and finished off at the throat with some rare lace, caught up here and there with tiny diamond pins.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22489",NA,"""By Jove! what a beautiful girl!"" was Mr. Pennell's inward ejaculation as he saw her drawing nearer the spot where he stood. It was strange that his first judgment of Harriet Brandt should have been the same as that of his cousin, Ralph Pullen, but it only proves from what a different standpoint men and women judge of beauty. As Harriet walked over the grass, Anthony Pennell noted each line of her swaying figure-each tint of her refined face-with the pretty little hands hanging by her side, and the slumbrous depths of her magnificent eyes. He did not, for one moment, associate her with the idea which he had formed of the West Indian heiress who was bent on capturing his cousin Ralph. He concluded she was another young friend who might be partaking of the Baroness's hospitality. He bowed low as she entered through the open French window looking as a Georgian or Cashmerian houri might have looked, he thought, if clad in the robes of civilization. Harriet bowed in return, and said timidly, ""I am so sorry that Madame Gobelli is not here to receive you, but she will not keep you waiting more than a few minutes I am sure. She particularly said that she would not be later than five o'clock.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22490",NA,"""She has left a very charming substitute in her place,"" replied Pennell, with another bow.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22491",NA,"""I believe you have come to see the china,"" continued Harriet. ""I do not know much about it myself, but Miss Wynward will be here in a minute and she knows the name of every piece and where it came from!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22492",NA,"""That will be eminently satisfactory,"" rejoined Anthony Pennell, ""but I happen to be a connoisseur in such things myself. I have one or two charming bits of old Sèvres and Majolica[118] in my chambers which I think the Baroness would like to see if she will honour me with a visit to my little place. A lonely bachelor like myself must take up some hobby, you know, to fill his life, and mine happens to be china. Madame Gobelli appears to have some lovely Chelsea there. I would like to steal one or two of those groups on the cabinet. Will you hold the door open for me whilst I run away with them?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22493",NA,"At this sally Harriet laughed and Mr. Pennell thought she looked even handsomer when she laughed than when she was pensive.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22494",NA,"""Here is the tea!"" she cried nervously, as Miss Wynward appeared with the tray. ""O! Miss Wynward, surely Madame cannot be much longer now! Have you looked down the road to see if she is coming?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22495",NA,"""The carriage has just turned into the stable yard,"" replied Miss Wynward, and in another minute the doorway was filled with the ample proportions of the Baroness.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22496",NA,"""'Olloa! Mr. Pennell, and so you've stolen a march upon me!"" was her first greeting, ""'ow are you?"" extending her enormous hand, ""'ave you been looking at the china? Wait till I've 'ad my tea; I'll shew you one or two bits that'll make your mouth water! It's my 'obby! I used to save my pocket money when I was a little gal to buy china. I remember my grandfather, the Dook of-but there, I 'aven't known you long enough to let you into family secrets. Let's 'ave our tea and talk afterwards! I 'ope 'Arriet 'as entertained you well!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22497",NA,"""This young lady-"" commenced Anthony Pennell, interrogatively.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22498",NA,"""To be sure, Miss 'Arriet Brandt! 'Asn't she introduced 'erself to you? She's like a daughter of the 'ouse to us! We look upon 'er as one of our own, Gustave and me! Miss Brandt from Jamaica! And she knew your cousin, Captain Pullen too, at Heyst, we all did, and we're dying to 'ear what 'as become of 'im, for 'e's never shewn 'is face at the Red 'Ouse!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22499",NA,"The murder was out now and Harriet waited tremblingly for the result! What did Mr. Pennell know? What would he say?","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22500",NA,"But Mr. Pennell said nothing-he was too much startled to speak. This, Harriet Brandt-this lovely girl, the quadroon of whom both Doctor Phillips and Mrs. Pullen had spoken so disparagingly?-of whom they had said that she was not fit to be the wife of any decent man? O! they must be fools and blind-or he was dreaming! The Baroness was not slow to see the look upon his face and to interpret it rightly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22501",NA,"""Are you surprised? You needn't look so incredulous! I give you my word that this is 'Arriet Brandt-the same young lady that knew Mrs. Pullen and her brother-in-law and Miss Leyton over at Heyst. What sort of a character 'ave they been giving 'er be'ind 'er back?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22502",NA,"""Indeed, I assure you, Madame-"" commenced Mr. Pennell, deprecatingly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22503",NA,"""You needn't take the trouble to tell any tarradiddles about it! I can see it in your face! I didn't think much of that cousin of yours from the beginning; 'e's got a shifty sort of look, and as for that cold bit of goods, Miss Leyton, well all I say is God 'elp the man that marries 'er, for she's enough to freeze the sun himself! But I liked Mrs. Pullen well enough and I was sorry to 'ear that she 'ad lost 'er baby, for she was quite wrapt up in it! But I daresay she'll soon 'ave another!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22504",NA,"Without feeling it incumbent on him to enter into an argument as to the probability of the Baroness's last suggestion, Anthony Pennell was glad of the digression as it gave him an opportunity of slurring over the dangerous subject of Ralph Pullen's character.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22505",NA,"""The loss of her child was a very great blow to my poor cousin,"" he replied, ""and she is still suffering from it, bitterly. Else, I have no doubt that you would have seen something of her-and the others,"" he added in a lower tone. After a slight interval he ventured to raise his eyes and see how the girl opposite to him had taken what was said, but it did not appear to have made much impression on her- she was, on the contrary, gazing at him with that magnetic glance of hers as though she wanted to read into his very soul.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22506",NA,"""Don't go and say that I want to see 'em,"" said the Baroness, as having devoured enough cake and bread and butter to feed an ordinary person for a day, she rose and led the way into another room. ""I don't want to see anybody at the Red 'Ouse that doesn't want to come and I 'aven't expected the ladies. But as for Captain Pullen, 'oo made an engagement to follow our party to Brussels, and then never took the trouble to write a line to excuse 'imself for breaking 'is word, why, I say 'e's a jerry sneak, and you may tell 'im so if you like! We didn't want 'im. 'E proposed to come 'imself, and I engaged 'is room and everything, and then 'e skedaddled without a word, and I call it beastly be'aviour. You mustn't mind my plain speaking, Mr. Pennell. I always say what I think! And I would like to break my stick over Captain Pullen's back and that's the truth.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22507",NA,"They were walking along the passage now, on their way to the Baron's library-the Baroness in front with her hand leaning heavily on Pennell's shoulder and Harriet lingering a little behind. Anthony Pennell pondered a while before he replied. Was this the time to announce Ralph's intended marriage. How would the girl behind them take it?","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22508",NA,"He turned slightly and looked at her face as the thought passed through his mind. Somehow the eyes that met his reassured him. He began to think it must be a mistake-that she did not care for Ralph as much as Mrs. Pullen had supposed-that she was only offended perhaps (as her hostess evidently was) by the curt and uncivil manner in which he had treated them both. So he replied, ""I have not the slightest excuse to make for my cousin's conduct, Madame Gobelli. It appears to me that he has treated you with very scant civility and he ought to be ashamed of himself. But as you know, his little niece's death was very sudden and unexpected and the least he could do was to escort his sister-in-law and Miss Leyton back to England, and since then--""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22509",NA,"""Well! and what since then?"" demanded the Baroness, sharply.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22510",NA,"""Lord Walthamstowe and he have come to an arrangement,"" said Pennell, speaking very slowly, ""that his marriage with Miss Elinor Leyton shall take place sooner than was at first intended. The Limerick Rangers are under orders for foreign service and Captain Pullen naturally wishes to take his wife out with him and though, of course, all this is no excuse for his omitting to write you a letter, the necessary preparations and the consequent excitement may have put his duty out of his head. Of course,"" he continued, ""you know that Ralph is engaged to marry Miss Leyton?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22511",NA,"""I 'eard something of it,"" replied the Baroness reluctantly, ""but one never knows what is true and what is not. Anyway, Captain Pullen didn't give out the news 'imself! 'E seemed 'appy enough without Miss Leyton, didn't 'e, 'Arriet?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22512",NA,"But turning round to emphasize her words, she found that Harriet had not followed them into the library. Whereupon she became confidential.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22513",NA,"""To tell you the truth, Mr. Pennell,"" she continued, ""'e just be'aved like a scoundrel to our little 'Arriet there. 'E ran after the gal all day, and spent all 'is evenings in our private sitting-room, gazing at 'er as if 'e would eat 'er, whilst she sang and played to 'im. 'E never said a word about marrying Miss Leyton. It was all ''Ally, 'Ally, 'Ally' with 'im. And if the gal 'adn't been a deal too clever for 'im, and wise enough to see what a vain zany 'e is, she might 'ave broken 'er 'eart over it. The conceited jackanapes!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22514",NA,"""But she has not fretted,"" said Anthony Pennell eagerly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22515",NA,"""Not she! I wouldn't let 'er! She's meat for Captain Pullen's master! A gal with fifteen 'undred a year in 'er own 'ands, and with a pair of eyes like that! O! no! 'Arriet can pick up a 'usband worth two of your cousin any day!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22516",NA,"""I should think so indeed,"" replied Mr. Pennell fervently. ""I have heard Mrs. Pullen mention Miss Brandt, but she did not prepare me for meeting so beautiful a girl. But I can hardly wonder at my cousin running away from her, Madame Gobelli. Knowing himself to be already engaged, Miss Brandt must have proved a most dangerous companion. Perhaps he found his heart was no longer under his own control and thought discretion the better part of valour. You must try and look upon his conduct in the best light you can!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22517",NA,"""O! well! it don't signify much anyway, for 'e's no miss at the Red 'Ouse, I can tell you, and 'Arriet could marry to-morrow if she chose, and to a man worthy of 'er. But now you must look at my Spode.""[119]","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22518",NA,"She walked up to a tall cabinet at one end of the room, which was piled with china, and took up a fragile piece in her hands.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22519",NA,"""Do you see that?"" she said, turning up the plate and shewing the mark upon the bottom. ""There it is, you see! There's the M. These five pieces are said to be the oldest in existence. And here's a cup of Limoges.[120] And that's Majolica. Do you know the marks of Majolica. They're some of the rarest known! A cross on a shield. The first real bit of china I ever possessed was a Strasbourg.[121] Have you ever seen any Dutch Pottery-marked with an A.P.?[122] I picked that up at an old Jew's shop in the market in Naples. And this Capo di Monte[123] strange to say, in a back alley in Brighton. There's nothing I like better than to grub about back slums and look for something good. Some of my best pieces 'ave come out of pawnbrokers' shops. That plate you're looking at is old Flemish-more than two 'undred years I believe! It came out of the rag market at Bruges. There used to be first rate pickings to be 'ad at Bruges and Ghent and in Antwerp some years ago, but the English 'ave pretty well cleared 'em out.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22520",NA,"""I never saw a better private collection, Madame Gobelli,"" said Anthony Pennell, as he gloated over the delicate morsels of Sèvres and Limoges and Strasbourg. ""The Baron should have had an old curiosity and bric-a-brac establishment, instead of anything so prosaic as boots and shoes.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22521",NA,"""O! I couldn't 'ave 'ad it!"" exclaimed the Baroness, ""it would 'ave gone to my 'eart to sell a good bargain when I 'ad made it! My cups and saucers and plates and teapots are like children to me, and if I thought my Bobby would sell 'em when I was gone I believe I should rise from my grave and whack 'im.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22522",NA,"The woman became almost womanly as her eyes rested lovingly on her art treasures. It seemed incongruous to Pennell to watch her huge coarse hands, with their thick stumpy fingers and broad chestnut nails, fingering the delicate fabric with apparent carelessness. Cup after cup and vase and plate she almost tossed over each other as she pushed some away to make room for others, and piled them up on the top of one another until he trembled lest they should all come toppling down together.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22523",NA,"""You are more used to handle these treasures than I am,"" he remarked presently. ""I should be too much afraid of smashing something, to move them so quickly as you do.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22524",NA,"""I never broke a bit of china in my life,"" returned the Baroness energetically. ""I've broken a stick over a man's back more than once, but never 'ad an accident with my plates and dishes. 'Ow do you account for that?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22525",NA,"""You must have a flow of good luck!"" said Mr. Pennell, ""I am so fearful for mine that I keep all the best under glass!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22526",NA,"""I 'ave more friends to 'elp me than perhaps you know of,"" said the Baroness, mysteriously, ""but it ain't only that! I never let a servant dust it! Miss Wynward does it, but she's too much afraid to do more than touch 'em with the tip of her feather brush. They come to me sometimes and complain that the china is dirty. 'Let it be dirty,' I say, 'that won't break it, but if you clean it you will!' Ha! ha! ha!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22527",NA,"At that moment Harriet Brandt entered the room, moving sinuously across the carpet as a snake might glide to its lair. Anthony Pennell could not take his eyes off that gliding walk of hers. It seemed to him the very essence of grace. It distracted all his attention from the china.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22528",NA,"""The Baron has just come in,"" observed Harriet to her hostess.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22529",NA,"""O! well! come along and leave the rest of the china till after dinner,"" said Madame Gobelli. ""Gustave likes to 'ave 'is dinner as soon as 'e comes 'ome.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22530",NA,"She thrust her arm through that of Anthony Pennell and conducted him to the dining-room where the Baron (without having observed the ceremony of changing his coat or boots) was already seated just as he had come in, at the table. He gave a curt nod to the visitor as Mr. Pennell's name was mentioned to him, and followed it up immediately by a query whether he would take fish. Mr. Pennell sat out the meal with increasing amazement at every course. He who was accustomed, in consequence of his popularity, to sit at the tables of some of the highest in the land, could liken this one to nothing but a farmhouse dinner. Course succeeded course in rapid succession, and there was no particular fault to find with anything but the utter want of ceremony-the mingling of well-known and aristocratic names with the boot and shoe trade-and the way in which the Baron and Baroness ate and drank filled him with surprise. The climax was reached when Mr. Milliken, who was late for dinner, entered the room and his hostess, before introducing him to the stranger, saluted him with a resounding smack on either cheek.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22531",NA,"Pennell thought it might be his turn next and shuddered. But the wine flowed freely and the Baroness, being in an undoubted good humour, the hospitality was unlimited. After dinner, the Baron having settled to sleep in an armchair, Madame Gobelli proposed that the party should amuse themselves with a game of ""Hunt the slippers.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22532",NA,"She was robed in an expensive satin dress, but she threw herself down on the ground with a resounding thump, and thrusting two enormous feet into view, offered her slipper as an inducement to commence the game.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22533",NA,"Pennell stood aloof, battling to restrain his laughter at the comical sight before him. The Baroness's foot, from which she had taken the shoe, was garbed in a black woollen stocking full of holes which displayed a set of bare toes. But apparently quite unaware of the ludicrous object she presented, she kept on calling out for Harriet Brandt and Miss Wynward to come and complete the circle at which only Mr. Milliken and herself were seated. But Harriet shrunk backwards and refused to play.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22534",NA,"""No! indeed, Madame, I cannot. I do not know your English games!"" she pleaded.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22535",NA,"""Come on, we'll teach you!"" screamed Madame Gobelli, ""'ere's Milliken, 'e knows all about it, don't you, Milliken? 'E knows 'ow to look for the slipper under the gal's petticoats. You come 'ere, 'Arriet, and sit next me, and Mr. Pennell shall be the first to 'unt. Come on!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22536",NA,"But Miss Brandt would not ""come on."" She remained seated and declared that she was too tired to play and did not care for les jeux innocents,[124] and she had a headache, and anything and everything, before she would comply with the outrageous request preferred to her.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22537",NA,"Madame Gobelli grumbled at her idleness and called her disobliging, but Anthony admired the girl for her steadfast refusal. He did not like to see her in the familiar society of such a woman as the Baroness-he would have liked still less to see her engaged in such a boisterous and unseemly game as ""Hunt the slipper.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22538",NA,"He took the opportunity of saying, ""Since you are disinclined for such an energetic game, Miss Brandt, perhaps you would oblige me by singing a song! I should so much like to hear the mandoline. Mrs. Pullen has spoken to me of your efficiency on it.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22539",NA,"""If Madame Gobelli wishes it, I have no objection,"" replied Harriet.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22540",NA,"""O! well! if you are all going to be so disagreeable as not to play a good game,"" said the Baroness, as Mr. Milliken pulled her on her feet again, ""'Arriet may as well sing to us! But a good romp first wouldn't 'ave done us any 'arm!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22541",NA,"She adjourned rather sulkily to a distant sofa with Mr. Milliken where they entertained each other whilst Harriet tuned her mandoline and presently let her rich voice burst forth in the strains of ""Oh! ma Charmante.""[125] Anthony Pennell was enchanted. He had a passion for music, and it appealed more powerfully to him than anything else. He sat in rapt attention until Harriet's voice had died away, and then he implored her to sing another song.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22542",NA,"""You cannot tell what it is for me, who care more for music than for anything else in this world, to hear a voice like yours. Why! you will create a perfect furore when you go into society. You could make your fortune on the stage, but I know you have no need of that!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22543",NA,"""O! one never knows what one may have need of,"" said Harriet gaily, as she commenced ""Dormez ma belle""[126] and sang it to perfection.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22544",NA,"""You must have had a very talented singing master,"" observed Pennell when the second song was finished.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22545",NA,"""Indeed no! My only instructress was a nun in the Ursuline Convent in Jamaica. But I always loved it,"" said the girl, as she ran over the strings of her mandoline in a merry little tarantelle which made everyone in the room feel as if they had been bitten by the spider from which it took its name, and wanted above all other things to dance.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22546",NA,"How Pennell revelled in the music and the performer! How he longed to hear from her own lips that Ralph's treatment had left no ill effects behind it.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22547",NA,"When she had ceased playing he drew nearer to her, and under the cover of the Baroness's conversation with Mr. Milliken and the Baron's snores, they managed to exchange a few words.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22548",NA,"""How can I ever thank you enough for the treat you have given me!"" he began.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22549",NA,"""I am very glad that you liked it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22550",NA,"""I was not prepared to hear such rare talent! My experience of young ladies' playing and singing has not hitherto been happy. But you have great genius. Did you ever sing to Mrs. Pullen whilst in Heyst?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22551",NA,"""Once or twice.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22552",NA,"""And to my cousin, Ralph Pullen?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22553",NA,"""Yes!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22554",NA,"""I cannot understand his having treated the Baroness with such scant courtesy. And you also, who had been kind enough to allow him to enjoy your society. You would not have found me so ungrateful. But you have heard doubtless that he is going to be married shortly!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22555",NA,"""Yes! I have heard it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22556",NA,"""And that has, I suppose, put everything else out of his head! Perhaps it may be as well, especially for his future wife. There are some things which are dangerous for men to remember-such as your lovely voice, for example!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22557",NA,"""Do you think so?"" Harriet fixed her dark eyes on him as she put the question.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22558",NA,"""I am sure it will be dangerous for me, unless you will give me leave to come and hear it again. I shall not be able to sleep for thinking of it. Do you think the Baroness will be so good as to enrol me as a visitor to the house?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22559",NA,"""You had better ask her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22560",NA,"""And if she consents, will you sing to me sometimes?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22561",NA,"""I am always singing or playing! There is nothing else to do here. The Baron and Baroness are almost always out and I have no company but that of Bobby and Miss Wynward. It is terribly dull, I can tell you. I am longing to get away, but I do not know where to go.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22562",NA,"""Have you no friends in England?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22563",NA,"""Not one, except Mr. Tarver, who is my solicitor!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22564",NA,"""That sounds very grim. If you will let me count myself amongst your friends, I shall be so grateful.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22565",NA,"""I should like it very much! I am not so ignorant as not to have heard your name and to know that you are a celebrated man. But I am afraid I shall prove a very stupid friend for you.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22566",NA,"""I have no such fear, and if I may come and see you sometimes I shall count myself a very happy man.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22567",NA,"""I am generally alone in the afternoons,"" replied Miss Brandt, sophistically.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22568",NA,"In another minute Mr. Pennell was saying good-night to his hostess and asking her permission to repeat his visit at some future time.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22569",NA,"""And if you and Miss Brandt would so far honour me, Madame Gobelli, as to come and have a little lunch at my chambers in Piccadilly, I shall feel myself only too much indebted to you. Perhaps we might arrange a matinée or a concert for the same afternoon, if it would please you? Will you let me know? And pray fix as early a date as possible. And I may really avail myself of your kind permission to come and see you again. You may be sure that I shall not forget to do so. Good-night! Good-night, Baron! Good-night, Miss Brandt!"" and with a nod to Mr. Milliken he was gone.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22570",NA,"""Ain't 'e a nice fellow? Worth two of that conceited jackanapes 'is cousin,"" remarked the Baroness as he disappeared, ""what do you think of 'im 'Arriet?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22571",NA,"""O! he is well enough,"" replied Miss Brandt with a yawn, as she prepared also to take her departure. ""He is taller and broader and stronger looking than Captain Pullen-and he must be very clever into the bargain.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22572",NA,"""And 'e never said a word about 'is books,"" exclaimed Madame Gobelli, ""only fancy!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22573",NA,"""No! he never said a word about his books,"" echoed Harriet.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22574",NA,"- CHAPTER XIV -","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22575",NA,"Anthony Pennell had promised to let Margaret Pullen hear the result of his visit to the Red House, and as he entered her presence on the following evening, she saluted him with the queries,","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22576",NA,"""Well! have you been there? Have you seen her?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22577",NA,"To which he answered soberly, ""Yes! I have been there and I have seen her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22578",NA,"""And what do you think of her? What did she say? I hope she was not rude to you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22579",NA,"""My dear Mrs. Pullen,"" said Pennell as he seated himself and prepared for a long talk, ""you must let me say in the first place, that I should never have recognised Miss Brandt from your description of her! You led me to expect a gauche schoolgirl, a half-tamed savage, or a juvenile virago. And I am bound to say that she struck me as belonging to none of the species. I sent your note of introduction to Madame Gobelli, and received a very polite invitation in return, in accordance with which I dined at the Red House yesterday.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22580",NA,"""You dined there!"" exclaimed Margaret with renewed interest. ""O! do tell me all about it, from the very beginning. What do you think of that dreadful woman the Baroness, and her little humpty Baron, and did you tell Miss Brandt of Ralph's impending marriage?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22581",NA,"""My dear lady, one question at a time, if you please. In the first place I arrived there rather sooner than I was expected and Madame Gobelli had not returned from her afternoon drive, but Miss Harriet Brandt did the honours of the tea-table in a very efficient manner and with as much composure and dignity as if she had been a duchess. We had a very pleasant time together until the Baroness burst in upon us!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22582",NA,"""Are you chaffing me?"" asked Margaret, incredulously. ""What do you really think of her?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22583",NA,"""I think she is, without exception, the most perfectly beautiful woman I have ever seen!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22584",NA,"""What!"" exclaimed his companion. She had thrown herself back in her armchair, and was regarding him as if he were perpetrating some mysterious joke which she did not understand. ""How extraordinary; how very extraordinary!"" she exclaimed at length, ""that is the very thing that Ralph said of her when they first met.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22585",NA,"""But why extraordinary? There are few men who would not endorse the opinion. Miss Brandt possesses the kind of beauty that appeals to the senses of animal creatures like ourselves. She has a far more dangerous quality than that of mere regularity of feature. She attracts without know-ing it. She is a mass of magnetism.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22586",NA,"""O! do go on, Mr. Pennell! Tell me how she received the news you went to break to her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22587",NA,"""I never broke it at all. There was no need to do so. Miss Brandt alluded to the magnificent Captain Pullen's marriage with the greatest nonchalance. She evidently estimates him at his true value, and does not consider him worth troubling her head about!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22588",NA,"""You astonish me! But how are we to account then for the attitude she assumed towards Miss Leyton, and the boast she made of Ralph's attentions to her?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22589",NA,"""Bravado, most likely! Miss Leyton goes to the Red House all aflame, like an angry turkey cock, and accuses Miss Brandt of having robbed her of her lover and what would you have the girl do? Not cry Peccavi,[127] surely and lower her womanhood? She had but one course-to brave it out. Besides, you have heard only one side of the question, remember! I can imagine Miss Leyton being very 'nasty' if she liked!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22590",NA,"""You forget the letters which Miss Brandt wrote to Ralph and which were found in his empty grate at Richmond!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22591",NA,"""I do not! I remember them as only another proof of how unworthy he is of the confidence of any woman.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22592",NA,"""Really, Mr. Pennell, you seem to be all on Miss Brandt's side!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22593",NA,"""I am, and for this reason. If your ideas concerning her are correct, she displayed a large amount of fortitude whilst speaking of your brother-in-law yesterday. But my own belief is that you are mistaken-that Miss Brandt is too clever for Ralph, or any of you-and that she cares no more for him in that way than you do. She considers, doubtless, that he has behaved in a most ungentlemanly manner towards them all, and so do I. I did not know what excuse to make for Ralph! I was ashamed to own him as a relation.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22594",NA,"""Harriet Brandt did then confide her supposed wrongs to you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22595",NA,"""Not at all! When she mentioned Ralph's name, it was like that of any other acquaintance. But when she was out of the room the Baroness told me that he had behaved like a scoundrel to the girl-that he had never confided the fact of his engagement to her, but run after her on every occasion and then after having promised to join their party in Brussels, and asked Madame Gobelli to engage his room for him, he left for England without even sending her a line of apology, nor has he taken the least notice of them since!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22596",NA,"""Ah! but you know the reason of his sudden departure!"" cried Margaret, her soft eyes welling over with tears.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22597",NA,"""My dear Mrs. Pullen,"" said Anthony Pennell sympathetically, ""even at that sad moment Ralph might have sent a telegram, or scratched a line of apology. We have to attend to such little courtesies, you know, even if our hearts are breaking! And how can you excuse his not having called on them or written since? No wonder the Baroness is angry. She did not restrain her tongue in speaking of him yesterday. She said she never wished to see his face again.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22598",NA,"""Does she know that Elinor went to the Red House?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22599",NA,"""I think not! There was no mention of her name!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22600",NA,"""Then I suppose we may at all events consider the affair une chose finie?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22601",NA,"""I hope so, sincerely! I should not advise Master Ralph to shew his face at the Red House again. The Baroness said she longed to lay her stick across his back, and I believe she is quite capable of doing so!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22602",NA,"""O! indeed she is,"" replied Margaret, smiling, ""we heard a great many stories of her valour in that respect from Madame Lamont, the landlady of the Lion d'Or. Has Miss Brandt taken up her residence altogether with Madame Gobelli?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22603",NA,"""I think not! She told me her life there was very dull and she should like to change it.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22604",NA,"""She is in a most unfortunate position for a young girl,"" remarked Margaret, ""left parentless, with money at her command, and in a strange country! And with the strange stigma attached to her birth-""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22605",NA,"""I don't believe in stigmas being attached to one's birth,"" returned Pennell hastily, ""the only stigmas worth thinking about are those we bring upon ourselves by our misconduct-such a one, for instance, as my cousin Ralph has done with regard to Miss Brandt! I would rather be in her shoes than his. Ralph thinks, perhaps, that being a stranger and friendless she is a fair game-""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22606",NA,"""Who is that, taking my name in vain?"" interrupted a languid voice at the open door, as Captain Pullen advanced into the room.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22607",NA,"Margaret Pullen started and grew very red at being detected in discussing her brother-in-law's actions, but Anthony Pennell, who was always ruffled by his cousin's affected walk and drawl, blurted the truth right out.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22608",NA,"""I was,"" he replied, hardly touching the hand which Captain Pullen extended to him. ""I was just telling Mrs. Pullen of the high estimation in which your name is held at the Red House!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22609",NA,"It was now Ralph's turn to grow red. His fair face flushed from chin to brow as he repeated, ""The Red House! what Red House?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22610",NA,"""Did they not mention the name to you? I mean the residence of Madame Gobelli, I was dining there yesterday.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22611",NA,"""Dining there, were you? By Jove! I didn't know you were acquainted with the woman. Isn't she a queer old party? Baroness Boots, eh? Fancy your knowing them! I thought you were a cut above that, Anthony!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22612",NA,"""If the Gobellis were good enough for you to be intimate with in Heyst, I suppose they are good enough for me to dine with in London, Ralph! I did not know until last evening, however, that you had left them to pay for your rooms in Brussels or I would have taken the money over with me to defray the debt.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22613",NA,"Ralph had seated himself by this time, but he looked very uneasy and as if he wished he had not come.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22614",NA,"""Did the old girl engage rooms for me?"" he stammered. ""Well! you know the reason I could not go to Brussels, but of course if I had known that she had gone to any expense for me I would have repaid her. Did she tell you of it herself ?"" he added, rather anxiously.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22615",NA,"""Yes! and a good many more things beside. As you have happened to come in whilst we are on the question, I had better make a clean breast of it. Perhaps you have heard that Miss Leyton has been to the Red House and had an interview with Miss Brandt!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22616",NA,"""Yes! I've just come from Richmond where we've had a jolly row over it,"" grumbled Ralph pulling his moustaches.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22617",NA,"""Your family all felt that that sort of thing could not go on-that it must end one way or the other, and therefore I went to the Red House, ostensibly to view Madame Gobelli's collection of china, but in reality to ascertain what view of the matter she and Miss Brandt took-and to undeceive them as to your being in a position to pursue your intimacy with the young lady any further.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22618",NA,"""And what the devil business have you to meddle in my private affairs?"" demanded Captain Pullen rousing himself.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22619",NA,"""Because, unfortunately, your mother happened to be my father's sister,"" replied Pennell sternly, ""and the scrapes you get in harm me more than they do yourself! One officer more or less, who gets into a scrape with women goes pretty well unnoticed, but I have attained a position in which I cannot afford to have my relations' names bandied about as having behaved in a manner unbecoming gentlemen.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22620",NA,"""Who dares to say that of me?"" cried Ralph angrily.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22621",NA,"""Everybody who knows of the attention you paid Miss Brandt in Heyst,"" replied Anthony Pennell boldly, ""and without telling her that you were already engaged to be married. I do not wonder at Miss Leyton being angry about it! I only wonder she consents to have any more to do with you in the circumstances.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22622",NA,"""O! we've settled all that!"" said Ralph, testily, ""we had the whole matter out at Richmond this afternoon and I've promised to be a good boy for the future, and never speak to a pretty woman again! You need not wonder any more about Elinor! She is only glad enough to get me back at any price!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22623",NA,"""Yes? And what about Miss Brandt?"" enquired Pennell.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22624",NA,"""Is she worrying about this affair?"" asked Captain Pullen, quickly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22625",NA,"""Not a bit! I think she estimates your attentions at their true value. I was alluding to the opinion she and her friends must have formed of your character as an officer and a gentleman.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22626",NA,"""O! I'll soon set all that right! I'll run over to the Red House and see the old girl, if you two will promise not to tell Elinor!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22627",NA,"""I should not advise you to do that! I am afraid you might get a warm reception. I think Madame Gobelli is quite capable of having you soused in the horse-pond. You would think the same if you had heard the names she called you yesterday.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22628",NA,"""What did she call me?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22629",NA,"""Everything she could think of. She considers you have behaved not only in a most ungentlemanly manner towards her, but in a most dishonourable one to Miss Brandt. She particularly told me to tell you that she never wished to see your face again.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22630",NA,"""Damn her!"" exclaimed Captain Pullen, wrathfully, ""and all her boots and shoes into the bargain. A vulgar, coarse old tradesman's wife! How dare she--""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22631",NA,"""Stop a minute Ralph! The Baroness's status in society makes no difference in this matter. You know perfectly well that you did wrong. Let us have no more discussion of the subject.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22632",NA,"Captain Pullen leaned back sulkily in his chair.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22633",NA,"""Well! if I did flirt a little bit more than was prudent with an uncommonly distracting little girl,"" he muttered presently, ""I am sure I have had to pay for it! Lord Walthamstowe insists that if I do not marry Elinor before the Rangers start for Malta the engagement shall be broken off, so I suppose I must do it! But it is a doosid nuisance to be tied up at five-and-twenty, before one has half seen life! What the dickens I am to do with her when I've got her, I'm sure I don't know!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22634",NA,"""O! you will find married life very charming when you're used to it!"" said Pennell consolingly, ""and Miss Leyton is everything a fellow could wish for in a wife! Only you must give up flirting, my boy, or if I mistake not, you'll find you've caught a tartar!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22635",NA,"""I expect to have to give up everything,"" said the other with a sour mouth.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22636",NA,"As soon as he perceived a favourable opportunity Anthony Pennell rose to take his leave. He did not wish to quarrel with Ralph Pullen about a girl whom he had only seen once, at the same time he feared for his own self-control if his cousin continued to mention the matter in so nonchalant a manner. Pennell had always despised Captain Pullen for his easy conceit with regard to women, and it seemed to him to have grown more detestably contemptible than before. He was anxious therefore to quit the scene of action. But to his annoyance, when he bade Margaret good-evening, Ralph also rose and expressed his wish to walk with him in the direction of his chambers.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22637",NA,"""I suppose you couldn't put me up for the night, old chappie!"" he said with his most languid air.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22638",NA,"""Decidedly not!"" replied Pennell. ""I have only my own bedroom and I've no intention of your sharing it. Why do you not go back to Richmond, or put up at an hotel?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22639",NA,"""Doosid inhospitable!"" remarked Captain Pullen, with a faded smile.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22640",NA,"""Sorry you think so, but a man cannot give what he does not possess. You had better stay and keep your sister-in-law company for a little while. I have work to do and am going straight home!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22641",NA,"""All right! I'll walk with you a little way,"" persisted Ralph, and the two young men left the house together.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22642",NA,"As soon as they found themselves in the street, Captain Pullen attacked his cousin eagerly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22643",NA,"""I say, Pennell, what is the exact direction of the Red House?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22644",NA,"""Why do you want to know?"" enquired his companion.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22645",NA,"""Because I feel that I owe the Baroness a visit. I acknowledge that I was wrong not to write and make my apologies, but you must know what it is-with a deuce of a lot of women to look after, and the whole gang crying their eyes out, and everything thrown on my shoulders, coffin, funeral, taking them over from Heyst to England and all-it was enough to drive everything else out of a man's head. You must acknowledge that.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22646",NA,"""You owe no excuses to me, Pullen, neither do I quite believe in them. You have had plenty of time since to remedy your negligence, even if you did forget to be courteous at the moment!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22647",NA,"""I know that, and you're quite right about the other thing. I had more reasons than one for letting the matter drop. You are a man and I can tell you with impunity what would set the women tearing my eyes out. I did flirt a bit with Harriet Brandt, perhaps more than was quite prudent in the circumstances-""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22648",NA,"""You mean the circumstance of your engagement to Miss Leyton?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22649",NA,"""Yes and no! If I had been free it would have been all the same- perhaps worse, for I should not have had a loophole of escape. For you see, Miss Brandt is not the sort of girl that any man could marry.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22650",NA,"""Why not?"" demanded Pennell with some asperity.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22651",NA,"""O! because-well! you should hear old Phillips talk of her and her parents. They were the most awful people, and she has black blood in her, her mother was a half-caste, so you see it would be impossible for any man in my position to think of marrying her! One might get a piebald son and heir! Ha! ha! ha! But putting all that aside, she is one of the demndest fascinating little women I ever came across-you would say so too, if you had seen as much of her as I did-I can't tell you what it is exactly, but she has a drawing way about her that pulls a fellow into the net before he knows what he is about. And her voice, by Jove!-have you heard her sing?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22652",NA,"""I have, but that has nothing to do that I can see with the subject under discussion. You, an engaged man, who had no more right to philander with a girl than if you had been married, appear to me to have followed this young lady about and paid her attentions which were, to say the least of them, compromising, never announcing the fact, meanwhile, that you were bound to Miss Leyton. After which you left her, without a word of explanation, to think what she chose of your conduct. And now you wish to see her again in order to apologise. Am I right?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22653",NA,"""Pretty well, only you make such a serious matter out of a little fun!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22654",NA,"""Well, then, I repeat that if you are wise you will save yourself the trouble, Ralph! Miss Brandt is happily too sensible to have been taken in by your pretence of making love to her. She estimates you at your true value. She knows that you are engaged to Elinor Leyton-that you were engaged all the time she knew you-and, I think, she rather pities Miss Leyton for being engaged to you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22655",NA,"But this point of view had never presented itself before to the inflated vanity of Ralph Pullen.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22656",NA,"""Pities her!"" he exclaimed, ""the devil!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22657",NA,"""I daresay it seems incomprehensible to you that any woman should not be thankful to accept at your hands the crumbs that may fall from another's table, but with regard to Miss Brandt I assure you it is true! And even were it otherwise I am certain Madame Gobelli would not admit you to her house. You know the sort of person she is! She can be very violent if she chooses, and the names she called you yesterday were not pretty ones. I had much trouble, as your relative, to stand by and listen to them quietly. Yet I could not say that they were undeserved!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22658",NA,"""O well! I daresay!"" returned Ralph, impatiently, ""let us allow, for the sake of argument, that you are right and that I behaved like a brute! The matter lies only between Hally Brandt and myself. The old woman has nothing to do with it! She never met the girl till she went to Heyst. What I want to do is to see Hally again and make my peace with her! You know how easily women are won over. A pretty present-a few kisses and excuses-a few tears-and the thing is done. I shouldn't like to leave England without making my peace with the little girl. Couldn't you get her to come to your chambers and let me meet her there? Then the Baroness need know nothing about it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22659",NA,"""I thought you told us just now that you had had a reconciliation with Miss Leyton on condition that you were to be a good boy for the future. Does that include a surreptitious meeting with Miss Brandt?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22660",NA,"""I suppose not, but we have to make all sorts of promises where women are concerned. A nice kind of life a man would lead if he consented to be tied to his wife's apron-strings and never go anywhere nor see anyone of whom she did not approve. I swore to everything she and old Walthamstowe asked me, just for peace's sake-but if they imagine I'm going to be hampered like that they must be greater fools than I take them for!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22661",NA,"""You must do as you think right, Pullen, but I am not going to help you to break your word!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22662",NA,"""Tell me where the Red House is! Tell me whereabouts Hally takes her daily walks!"" urged Captain Pullen.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22663",NA,"""I shall tell you nothing-you must find out for yourself!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22664",NA,"""Well! you are damned particular!"" exclaimed his cousin, ""one would think this little half-caste was a princess of the Blood Royal. What is she, when all's said and done? The daughter of a mulatto and a man who made himself so detested that he was murdered by his own servants-the bastard of a--""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22665",NA,"""Stop!"" cried Pennell so vehemently that the passers-by turned their heads to look at him. ""I don't believe it, and if it is true I do not wish to hear it! Miss Brandt may be all that you say-I am not in a position to contradict your assertions-but to me she represents only a friendless and unprotected woman who has a right to our sympathy and respect.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22666",NA,"""A friendless woman!"" sneered Captain Pullen, ""yes! and a doosid good-looking one into the bargain, eh, my dear fellow, and much of your sympathy and respect she would command if she were ugly and humpbacked. O! I know you, Pennell! It's no use your coming the benevolent Samaritan over me! You have an eye for a jimper[128] waist and a trim ancle as well as most men. But I fancy your interest is rather thrown away in this quarter. Miss Brandt has a thorny path before her. She is a young lady who will have her own way and with the glorious example of the Baroness the way is not likely to be too carefully chosen. To tell the truth, old boy, I ran away because I was afraid of falling into the trap. The girl wishes intensely to be married, and she is not a girl whom men will marry, and so-we need go no further. Only, I should not be surprised if, notwithstanding her fortune and her beauty, we should find Miss Harriet Brandt figuring before long, amongst the free lances of London.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22667",NA,"""And you would have done your best to send her there!"" replied Anthony Pennell indignantly, as he stopped on the doorstep of his Piccadilly chambers. ""But I am glad to say that your folly has been frustrated this time, and Miss Brandt sees you as you are! Good-night!"" and without further discussion he turned on his heel and walked upstairs.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22668",NA,"""By Jove!"" thought Ralph, as he too went on his way, ""I believe old Anthony is smitten with the girl himself, though he has only seen her once! That was the most remarkable thing about her-the ease with which she seemed to attract, looking so innocent all the while, and the deadly strength with which she resisted one's efforts to get free again. Perhaps it is as well after all that I should not meet her. I don't believe I could trust myself, only speaking of her seems to have revived the old sensation of being drawn against my will- hypnotised I suppose the scientists would call it-to be near her, to touch her, to embrace her, until all power of resistance is gone. But I do hope old Anthony is not going to be hypnotised. He's too good for that.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22669",NA,"Meanwhile Pennell, having reached his rooms, lighted the gas, threw himself into an armchair, and rested his head upon his hands.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22670",NA,"""Poor little girl!"" he murmured to himself, ""Poor little girl!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22671",NA,"Anthony Pennell was a Socialist in the best and truest sense of the word. He loved his fellow creatures, both high and low, better than he loved himself. He wanted all to share alike-to be equally happy, equally comfortable-to help and be helped, to rest and depend upon one another. He knew that the dream was only a dream- that it would never be fulfilled in his time, nor any other; that some men would be rich and some poor as long as the world lasts, and that what one man can do to alleviate the misery and privation and suffering with which we are surrounded is very little. What little Pennell could do, however, to prove that his theories were not mere talk, he did. He made a large income by his popular writings and the greater part of it went to relieve the wants of his humbler friends, not through governors and secretaries and the heads of charitable Societies, but from his own hand to theirs. But his Socialism went further and higher than this. Money was not the only thing which his fellow creatures required-they wanted love, sympathy, kindness, and consideration-and these he gave also, wherever he found that there was need. He set his face pertinaciously against all scandal and back-biting and waged a perpetual warfare against the tyranny of men over women; the ill-treatment of children; and the barbarities practised upon dumb animals and all living things. He was a liberal minded man, with a heart large enough and tender enough to belong to a woman-with a horror of cruelty and a great compassion for everything that was incapable of defending itself.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22672",NA,"He was always writing in defence of the People, calling the attention of those in authority to their misfortunes; their evil chances; their lack of opportunity; and their patience under tribulation. For this purpose and in order to know them thoroughly he had gone and lived amongst them; shared their filthy dens in Whitechapel, partaken of their unappetising food in Stratford, and watched them at their labour in Homerton. His figures and his kindly face were well-known in some of the worst and most degraded parts of London, and he could pass anywhere without fear of a hand being lifted up against him, or an oath called after him in salutation. Anthony Pennell was, in fact, a general lover-a lover of Mankind.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22673",NA,"And that is why he leant his head upon his hand as he ejaculated with reference to Harriet Brandt, ""Poor little girl.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22674",NA,"It seemed so terrible in his eyes that just because she was friendless and an orphan, just because her parents had been, perhaps unworthy, just because she had a dark stream mingling with her blood, just because she needed the more sympathy and kindness, the more protection and courtesy, she should be considered fit prey for the sensualist-a fit subject to wipe men's feet upon!","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22675",NA,"What difference did it make to Harriet Brandt herself, that she was marked with an hereditary taint? Did it render her less beautiful, less attractive, less graceful and accomplished? Were the sins of the fathers ever to be visited upon the children?-was no sympathetic fellow-creature to be found to say, ""If it is so, let us forget it! It is not your fault nor mine! Our duty is to make each other's lives as happy as possible and trust the rest to God.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22676",NA,"He hoped, as he sat there, that before long Harriet Brandt would find a friend for life who would never remind her of anything outside her own loveliness and lovable qualities.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22677",NA,"Presently he rose with a sigh, and going to his bookcase drew thence an uncut copy of his last work, ""God and the People."" It had been a tremendous success, having already reached the tenth edition. It dealt largely, as its title indicated, with his favourite theory but it was light and amusing also, full of strong nervous language and bristling every here and there with wit-not strained epigrams such as no Society conversation-alists ever tossed backward and forward to each other-but honest, mirth-provoking humour, arising from the humorous side of Pennell's own character, which ever had a good-humoured jest for the oddities and comicalities of everyday life.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22678",NA,"He regarded the volume for a moment as though he were considering if it were an offering worthy of its destination, and then he took up a pen and transcribed upon the fly leaf the name of Harriet Brandt-only her name, nothing more.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22679",NA,"""She seems intelligent,"" he thought, ""and she may like to read it. Who knows, if there is any fear of the sad destiny which Ralph prophesies for her, whether I may not be happy enough to turn her ideas into a worthier and more wholesome direction. With an independent fortune how much good might she not accomplish amongst those less happily situated than herself! But the other idea-No, I will not entertain it for a moment! She is too good, too pure, too beautiful for so horrible a fate! Poor little girl! Poor, poor little girl!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22680",NA,"- CHAPTER XV -","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22681",NA,"The holiday season being now over and the less fashionable people returned to Town, Harriet Brandt's curiosity was much excited by the number of visitors who called at the Red House but were never shewn into the drawing-room. As many as a dozen might arrive in the course of an afternoon and were taken by Miss Wynward straight upstairs to the room where Madame Gobelli and Mr. Milliken so often shut themselves up together. These mysterious visitors were not objects of charity either, but well-dressed men and women, some of whom came in their own carriages and all of whom appeared to be of the higher class of society. The Baroness had left off going to the factory also, and stayed at home every day, apparently with the sole reason of being at hand to receive her visitors.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22682",NA,"Harriet could not understand it at all, and after having watched two fashionably attired ladies accompanied by a gentleman ascend the staircase to Madame Gobelli's room one afternoon, she ventured to sound Miss Wynward on the subject.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22683",NA,"""Who were the ladies who went upstairs just now?"" she asked.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22684",NA,"""Friends of the Baroness, Miss Brandt!"" was the curt reply.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22685",NA,"""But why do they not come down to the drawing-room then? What does Madame Gobelli do with them in that little room upstairs? I was passing one day just after some one had entered and I heard the key turned in the lock. What is all the secrecy about?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22686",NA,"""There is no secrecy on my part, Miss Brandt. You know the position I hold here. When I have shewn the visitors upstairs, according to my Lady's directions, my duty is done!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22687",NA,"""But you must know why they come to see her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22688",NA,"""I know nothing. If you are curious on the subject you must ask the Baroness.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22689",NA,"But Harriet did not like to do that. The Baroness had become less affectionate to her of late-her fancy was already on the wane-she no longer called the attention of strangers to her young friend as the ""daughter of the house""-and Harriet felt the change, though she could scarcely have defined where it exactly lay. She had begun to feel less at home in her hostess's presence, and her high spirit chafed at the alteration in her manner. She realised, as many had done before her, that she had out-stayed her welcome. But her curiosity respecting the people who visited Madame Gobelli upstairs was none the less. She confided it to Bobby-poor Bobby who grew whiter and more languid every day-but her playful threat to invade the sacred precincts and find out what the Baroness and her friends were engaged upon was received by the youth with horror. He trembled as he begged her not to think of such a thing.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22690",NA,"""Hally, you mustn't, indeed you mustn't! You don't know-you have no idea-what might not happen to you if you offended Mamma by breaking in upon her privacy. O! don't, pray don't! She can be so terrible at times-I do not know what she might not do or say!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22691",NA,"""My dear Bobby, I was only in fun! I have not the least idea of doing anything so rude. Only, if you think that I am frightened of your Mamma or any other woman, you are very much mistaken. It's all nonsense! No one person can harm another in this world!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22692",NA,"""O! yes, they can-if they have help,"" replied the boy, shaking his head.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22693",NA,"""Help! what help? The help of Mr. Milliken, I suppose! I would rather fight him than the Baroness any day-but I fear neither of them.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22694",NA,"""O! Hally, you are wrong,"" said the lad, ""you must be careful, indeed you must-for my sake!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22695",NA,"""Why! you silly Bobby, you are actually trembling! However, I promise you I will do nothing rash! And I shall not be here much longer now! Your Mamma is getting tired of me, I can see that plainly enough! She has hardly spoken a word to me for the last two days. I am going to ask Mr. Pennell to advise me where to find another home!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22696",NA,"""No! no!"" cried the lad, clinging to her, ""you shall not leave us! Mr. Pennell shall not take you away! I will kill him first!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22697",NA,"He was getting terribly jealous of Anthony Pennell, but Harriet laughed at his complaints and reproaches as the emanations of a love-sick school boy. She was flattered by his feverish longing for her society and his outspoken admiration of her beauty, but she did not suppose for one moment that Bobby was capable of a lasting or dangerous sentiment.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22698",NA,"Mr. Pennell had become a familiar figure at the Red House by this time. His first visit had been speedily succeeded by another, at which he had presented Harriet Brandt with the copy of his book- an attention which, had he known it, flattered her vanity more than any praises of her beauty could have done. A plain woman likes to be told that she is good-looking, a handsome one that she is clever. Harriet Brandt was not unintelligent, on the contrary she had inherited a very fair amount of brains from her scientific father-but no one ever seemed to have found it out until Anthony Pennell came her way. She was a little tired of being told that she had lovely eyes and the most fascinating smile, she knew all that by heart and craved for something new. Mr. Pennell had supplied the novelty by talking to her as if her intellect were on a level with his own-as if she were perfectly able to understand and sympathise with his quixotic plans for the alleviation of the woes of all mankind-with his Arcadian dreams of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity,-and might help them also, if she chose, not with money only but by raising her own voice in the Cause of the People. Harriet had never been treated so by anyone before and her ardent, impetuous, passionate nature which had a large amount of gratitude in its composition, fixed itself upon her new friend with a vehemence which neither of them would find it easy to overcome-or to disentangle themselves from. Her love (eager to repair the void left by the desertion of Captain Pullen) had poured itself, by means of looks and sighs and little timid, tender touches upon Anthony Pennell like a mountain torrent that had burst its bounds, and he had been responsive-he had opened his arms to receive the flood, actuated not only by the admiration which he had conceived for her from the first, but by the intense yearning pity which her loneliness and friendlessness had evoked in his generous compassionate nature. In fact they were desperately in love with each other and Harriet was expecting, each time he came, to hear Anthony Pennell say that he could no longer live without her. And Bobby looked on from a little distance-and suffered. The next time that Mr. Pennell came to see her, Harriet confided to him the mystery of the upstairs room and asked his opinion as to what it could possibly mean.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22699",NA,"""Perhaps they are people connected with the boot trade,"" suggested Anthony jestingly, ""does Madame keep a stock of boots and shoes up there do you think?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22700",NA,"""O! no! Mr. Pennell, you must not joke about it! This is something serious! Poor Bobby grew as white as a sheet when I proposed to make a raid upon the room some day and discover the mystery, and said that his mother was a terrible woman and able to do me great harm if I offended her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22701",NA,"""I quite agree with Bobby in his estimate of his Mamma being a terrible woman,"" replied Mr. Pennell, ""but it is all nonsense about her being able to harm you! I should soon see about that!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22702",NA,"""What would you do?"" asked Harriet, with downcast eyes.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22703",NA,"""What would I not do to save you from anything disagreeable, let alone anything dangerous. But the Baroness is too fond of you, surely, to do you any harm!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22704",NA,"Harriet pursed up her lips.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22705",NA,"""I am not so sure about her being fond of me, Mr. Pennell! She used to profess to be, I know, but lately her manner has very much altered. She will pass half a day without speaking a word to me, and they have cut off wine and champagne and everything nice from the dinner table. I declare the meals here are sometimes not fit to eat. And I believe they grudge me the little I consider worthy my attention.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22706",NA,"""But why do you stay here if you fancy you are not welcome?"" asked Pennell, earnestly, ""you are not dependent on these people or their hospitality.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22707",NA,"""But where am I to go?"" said the girl. ""I know no one in London, and Miss Wynward says that I am too young to live at an hotel by myself!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22708",NA,"""Miss Wynward is quite right! You are far too young and too beautiful. You don't know what wicked men and women there are in the world who would delight in fleecing an innocent lamb like you. But I can soon find you a home where you could stay in respectability and comfort, until-until--""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22709",NA,"""Until what,'"" asked Harriet, with apparent ingenuousness, for she knew well enough what was coming.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22710",NA,"They were seated on one of those little couches made expressly for conversation, where a couple can sit back to back with their faces turned to one another. Harriet half raised her slumbrous black eyes as she put the question and met the fire in his own. He stretched out his arms and caught her round the waist.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22711",NA,"""Hally! Hally! you know-there is no need for me to tell you! Will you come home to me, dearest? Don't ever say that you are friendless again! Here is your friend and your lover and your devoted slave for ever! My darling-my beautiful Hally, say you will be my wife-and make me the very happiest man in all the world!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22712",NA,"She did not shrink from his warm wooing-that was not her nature! Her eyes waked up and flashed fire responsive to his own; she let her head rest on his shoulder and turned her lips upwards eagerly to meet his kiss, she cooed her love into his ear and clasped him tightly round the neck as if she would never let him go.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22713",NA,"""I love you-I love you,"" she kept on murmuring, ""I have loved you from the very first!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22714",NA,"""O! Hally, how happy it makes me to hear you say so,"" he replied, ""how few women have the honesty and courage to avow their love as you do. My sweet child of the sun! The women in this cold country have no idea of the joy that a mutual love like ours has the power to bestow. We will love each other for ever and ever my Hally, and when our bodies are withered by age our spirits shall still go loving on.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22715",NA,"He-the man whose whole thoughts thitherto had been so devoted to the task of ameliorating the condition of his fellow-creatures that he had had no time to think of dalliance, succumbed as fully to its pleasures now as the girl whose life had simply been a ripening process for the seed which had burst forth into flower. They were equally passionate-equally loving-equally unreserved-and they were soon absorbed in their own feelings and noticed nothing that was taking place around them.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22716",NA,"But they were not as entirely alone as they imagined. A pale face full of misery was watching them through one of the panes in the French windows, gazing at what seemed like his death doom, too horribly fascinated to tear himself away. Bobby stood there and saw Hally-his Hally, as he had often fondly called her, without knowing the meaning of the word-clasped in the arms of this stranger, pressing her lips to his and being released with tumbled hair and a flushed face, only to seek the source of her delight again. At last Bobby could stand the bitter sight no longer and with a low moan he fled to his own apartment and flung himself, face downward on the bed. And Anthony Pennell and Harriet Brandt continued to make love to each other until the shadows lengthened and six o'clock was near at hand.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22717",NA,"""I must go now, my darling,"" he said at last, ""though it is hard to tear myself away. But I am so happy, Hally, so very, very happy, that I dare not complain.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22718",NA,"""Why cannot you stay the evening?"" she urged.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22719",NA,"""I had better not! I have not been asked in the first instance, and if what you say about the Baroness's altered demeanour towards yourself be true, I am afraid I should find it difficult to keep my temper. But we part for a very short time, my darling! The first thing to-morrow I shall see about another home for you, where I can visit you as freely as I like! And as soon as it can ever be, Hally, we will be married-is that a promise?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22720",NA,"""A promise, yes! a thousand times over, Anthony! I long for the time when I shall be your wife!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22721",NA,"""God bless you, my sweet! You have made my future life look all sunshine! I will write to you as soon as ever I have news and then you will lose no time in leaving your present home, will you?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22722",NA,"""Not an instant that I can help,"" replied Harriet, eagerly, ""I am longing to get away. I feel that I have lost my footing here!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22723",NA,"And with another long embrace the lovers parted. As soon as Anthony had left her, Harriet ran up to her room to cool her feverish face and change her dress for dinner. She was really and truly fond of the man she had just promised to marry, and if anything could have the power to transform her into a thinking and responsible woman it would be marriage with Anthony Pennell. She was immensely proud that so clever and popular a writer should have chosen her from out the world of women to be his wife, and she loved him for the excellent qualities he had displayed towards his fellow men, as well as for the passionate warmth he had shewn for herself. She was a happier girl than she had ever been in all her life before as she stood, flushed and triumphant, in front of her mirror and saw the beautiful light in her dark eyes and the luxuriant growth of her dusky hair, and the carmine of her lips, and loved every charm she possessed for Anthony's sake. She felt less vexed even with the Baroness than she had done, and determined that she would not break the news of her intended departure from the Red House that evening, but try to leave as pleasant an impression behind her as she could! And she put on the lemon-coloured frock, though Anthony was not there to see it, from a feeling that since he approved of her she must be careful of her appear-ance for the future to do justice to his opinion.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22724",NA,"Madame Gobelli appeared to be in a worse temper than usual that evening. She stumped in to the dining-room and took her seat at table without vouchsafing a word to Harriet although she had not seen her since luncheon time. She found fault with everything that Miss Wynward did, and telling her that she grew stupider and stupider each day, ordered her to attend her upstairs after dinner as she had some friends coming and needed her assistance. The ex-governess did not answer at first and the Baroness sharply demanded if she had heard her speak.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22725",NA,"""Yes! my lady,"" she replied, slowly, ""but I trust that you will excuse my attendance, as I have made an engagement for this evening!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22726",NA,"Madame Gobelli boiled over with rage.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22727",NA,"""Engagement! What do you mean by making an engagement without asking my leave first? You can't keep it! I want you to 'elp me in some thing and you'll 'ave to come!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22728",NA,"""You must forgive me,"" repeated Miss Wynward, firmly, ""but I cannot do as you wish!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22729",NA,"Harriet opened her eyes in amazement. Miss Wynward refusing a request from Madame Gobelli. What would happen next?","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22730",NA,"The Baroness grew scarlet in the face. She positively trembled with rage.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22731",NA,"""'Old your tongue!"" she screamed. ""You'll do as I say, or you leave my 'ouse.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22732",NA,"""Then I will leave your house!"" replied Miss Wynward.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22733",NA,"Madame Gobelli was thunderstruck! Where was this insolent menial, who had actually dared to defy her, going? What friends had she? What home to go to? She had received no salary from her for years past, but had accepted board and lodging and cast-off clothes in return for her services. How could she face the world without money?","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22734",NA,"""You go at your peril,"" she exclaimed, hoarse with rage, ""you know what will 'appen to you if you try to resist me! I 'ave those that will 'elp me to be revenged on my enemies! You know that those I 'ate, die! And when I 'ave my knife in a body, I turn it! You 'ad better be careful and think twice about what you're going to do.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22735",NA,"""Your ladyship cannot frighten me any longer,"" replied Miss Wynward, calmly. ""I thank God and my friends that I have got over that! Nor do I believe any more in your boasted powers of revenge! If they are really yours, you should be ashamed to use them.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22736",NA,"""Gustave!"" shrieked the Baroness, ""get up and put this woman from the door. She don't stop in the Red 'Ouse another hour! Let 'er pack up 'er trumpery and go! Do you 'ear me, Gustave? Turn 'er out of the room!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22737",NA,"""Mein tear! mein tear! a little patience! Miss Wynward will go quietly! But the law, mein tear, the law! We must be careful!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22738",NA,"""Damn the law!"" exclaimed the Baroness. ""'Ere, where's that devil Bobby? Why ain't 'e at dinner? What's the good of my 'aving a 'usband and a son if neither of 'em will do my bidding!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22739",NA,"Then everyone looked round and discovered that Bobby was not at the table.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22740",NA,"""Where's Bobby?"" demanded the Baroness of the servant in waiting.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22741",NA,"""Don't know, I'm sure,"" replied the domestic who, like most of Madame Gobelli's dependents, talked as familiarly with her as though they had been on an equality. ""The last time I saw 'im was at luncheon.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22742",NA,"""I will go and look for him,"" said Miss Wynward quietly, as she rose from table.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22743",NA,"""No! you don't!"" exclaimed the Baroness insolently, ""you don't touch my child nor my 'usband again whilst you remain under this roof. I won't 'ave them polluted by your fingers. 'Ere, Sarah, you go upstairs and see if Bobby's in 'is room. It'll be the worse for 'im if 'e isn't.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22744",NA,"Sarah took her way upstairs, in obedience to her employer's behest and the next minute a couple of shrieks, loud and terrified, proceeded from the upper story. They were in Sarah's voice and they startled everyone at the dinner table.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22745",NA,"""O! what is that?"" exclaimed Harriet, as her face grew white with fear.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22746",NA,"""Something is wrong!"" said Miss Wynward, as she hastily left the room.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22747",NA,"The Baroness said nothing, until Miss Wynward's voice was heard calling out over the banisters, ""Baron! will you come here, please, at once!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22748",NA,"Then she said, ""Gustave! 'elp me up,"" and steadying herself by means of her stick, she proceeded to the upper story accompanied by her hus-band and Harriet Brandt. They were met on the landing by Miss Wynward who addressed herself exclusively to the Baron.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22749",NA,"""Will you send for a doctor at once,"" she said eagerly, ""Bobby is very ill, very ill, indeed!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22750",NA,"""What is the matter?"" enquired the stolid German.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22751",NA,"""It's all rubbish!"" exclaimed Madame Gobelli, forcing her way past the ex-governess, ""'ow can 'e be ill when 'e was running about all the morn-ing? 'Ere, Bobby,"" she continued, addressing the prostrate figure of her son which was lying face downward on the bed, ""get up at once and don't let's 'ave any of your nonsense, or I'll give you such a taste of my stick as you've never 'ad before! Get up, I say, at once now!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22752",NA,"She had laid hold of her son's arm and was about to drag him down upon the floor when Miss Wynward interposed with a face of horror.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22753",NA,"""Leave him alone!"" she cried, indignantly, ""Woman! cannot you see what is the matter? Your son has left you! He is dead!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22754",NA,"The Baroness was about to retort that it was a lie and she didn't believe it when a sudden trembling overtook her which she was powerless to resist. Her whole face shook as if every muscle had lost control and her cumbersome frame followed suit. She did not cry, nor call out, but stood where the news had reached her, immovable except for that awful shaking which made her sway from head to foot. The Baron on hearing the intelligence turned round to go downstairs and dispatch William, who was employed in the stables, in search of a medical man. Miss Wynward took the lifeless body in her arms and tenderly turned it over, kissing the pallid face as she did so-when Harriet Brandt, full of mournful curiosity, advanced to have a look at her dead playmate. Her appearance, till then unnoticed, seemed to wake the paralysed energies of the Baroness into life. She pushed the girl from the bed with a violence that sent her reeling against the mantelshelf, whilst she exclaimed furiously,","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22755",NA,"""Out of my sight! Don't you dare to touch 'im! This is all your doing, you poisonous, wicked creature!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22756",NA,"Harriet stared at her hostess in amazement! Had she suddenly gone mad with grief?","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22757",NA,"""What do you mean, Madame?"" she cried.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22758",NA,"""What I say! I ought to 'ave known better than to let you enter an 'ouse of mine! I was a fool not to 'ave left you be'ind me at Heyst, to practise your devilish arts on your army captains and foreign grocers, instead of letting you come within touch of my innocent child!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22759",NA,"""You are mad!"" cried Harriet, ""what have I done? Do you mean to insinuate that Bobby's death has anything to do with me?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22760",NA,"""It is you 'oo 'ave killed 'im,"" screamed the Baroness, shaking her stick, ""it's your poisonous breath that 'as sapped 'is! I should 'ave seen it from the beginning. Do you suppose I don't know your 'istory? Do you think I 'aven't 'eard all about your parents and their vile doings-that I don't know that you're a common bastard, and that your mother was a devilish negress, and your father a murderer? Why didn't I listen to my friends and forbid you the 'ouse?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22761",NA,"""Miss Wynward!"" said Harriet, who had turned deadly white at this unexpected attack, ""what can I say? What can I do?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22762",NA,"""Leave the room, my dear, leave the room! Her ladyship is not herself! She does not know what she is saying!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22763",NA,"""Don't I?"" screamed Madame Gobelli, barring the way to the door, ""I am telling 'er nothing but the truth, and she doesn't go till she 'as 'eard it! She has the vampire's blood in 'er and she poisons everybody with whom she comes in contact. Wasn't Mrs. Pullen and Mademoiselle Brimont both taken ill from being too intimate with 'er, and didn't the baby die because she carried it about and breathed upon it? And now she 'as killed my Bobby in the same way-curse 'er!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22764",NA,"Even when reiterating the terrible truth in which she evidently believed, Madame Gobelli shewed no signs of breaking down, but stood firm, leaning heavily on her stick and trembling in every limb.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22765",NA,"Harriet Brandt's features had assumed a scared expression.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22766",NA,"""Miss Wynward!"" she stammered piteously, ""O! Miss Wynward! this cannot be true!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22767",NA,"""Of course not! Of course not!"" replied the other soothingly, ""her ladyship will regret that she has spoken so hastily to you to-morrow.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22768",NA,"""I shan't regret it!"" said the Baroness sturdily, ""for it is the truth! Her father and her mother were murderers who were killed by their own servants in revenge for their atrocities, and they left their curse upon this girl-the curse of black blood and of the vampire's blood which kills everything which it caresses. Look back over your past life,"" she continued to Harriet, ""and you'll see that it's the case! And if you don't believe me, go and ask your friend Doctor Phillips, for 'e knew your infamous parents and the curse that lies upon you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22769",NA,"""Madame! Madame!"" cried Miss Wynward, ""is this a moment for such recrimination? If all this were true, it is no fault of Miss Brandt's! Think of what lies here, and that he loved her, and the thought will soften your feelings!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22770",NA,"""But it don't!"" exclaimed the Baroness, ""when I look at my dead son, I could kill 'er, because she 'as killed 'im.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22771",NA,"And in effect, she advanced upon Harriet with so vengeful a look that the girl, with a slight cry, darted from the room and rushed into her own.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22772",NA,"""For shame!"" said Miss Wynward, whose previous fear of the Baroness seemed to have entirely evaporated, ""how dare you intimidate an innocent woman in the very presence of Death?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22773",NA,"""Don't you try to browbeat me!"" replied the Baroness.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22774",NA,"""I will tell you what I think,"" said Miss Wynward boldly, ""and that is, that you should blush to give way to your evil temper in the face of God's warning to yourself! You accuse that poor girl of unholy dealings-what can you say of your own? You, who for years past have made money by deceiving your fellow creatures in the grossest manner-who have professed to hold communication with the spiritual world for their satisfaction, when if any spirits have come to you they must have been those of devils akin to your own! And because I refused to help you to deceive-to take the place of that miserable cur Milliken and play cheating tricks with cards, and dress up stuffed figures to further your money-getting ends, you threatened me with loss of home and character and friends until, God forgive me, I consented to further the fraud from fear of starving. But now, thank Heaven, I have no more fear of you! Yes! you may shake your stick at me and threaten to take my life, but it is useless! This,"" pointing to the dead boy upon the bed, ""was the only tie I had to the Red House and as soon as he is dressed for his grave I shall leave you for ever!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22775",NA,"""And where would you go?"" enquired the Baroness. The voice did not sound like her own; it was the cracked dry voice of a very old woman.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22776",NA,"""That is no concern of yours, my lady,"" replied Miss Wynward, as she prepared to quit the room. ""Be good enough to let me pass! The inexcusable manner in which you have insulted that poor young lady, Miss Brandt, makes me feel that my first duty is to her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22777",NA,"""I forbid you-"" commenced Madame Gobelli in her old tone, but the ex-governess simply looked her in the face and passed on. She made the woman feel that her power was gone.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22778",NA,"Miss Wynward found Harriet in her own room, tossing all her possessions into her travelling trunks. There was no doubt of her intention. She was going to leave the Red House.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22779",NA,"""Not at this time of night, my dear,"" said Miss Wynward, kindly, ""it is nearly nine o'clock.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22780",NA,"""I would go if I had to walk the street all night!"" replied Harriet, feverishly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22781",NA,"Her eyes were inflamed with crying and she shook like an aspen leaf.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22782",NA,"""O! Miss Wynward, such awful things to say! What could she mean? What have I done to be so cruelly insulted? And when I am so sorry for poor Bobby too!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22783",NA,"She began to cry afresh as she threw dresses, mantles, stockings, and shoes one on the top of the other, in her endeavours to pack as quickly as possible.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22784",NA,"""Let me help you, dear Miss Brandt! It is cruel that you should be driven from the house in this way! But I am going too, as soon as the doctor has been and dear Bobby's body may be prepared for burial. It is a great grief to me, Miss Brandt, I have had the care of him since he was five years old and I loved him like my own. But I am glad he is dead! I am glad he has escaped from it all, for this is a wicked house, a godless, deceiving and slanderous house, and this trouble has fallen on it as a Nemesis. I will not stay here a moment longer now he has gone! I shall join my friends to-morrow.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22785",NA,"""I am glad you have friends,"" said Harriet, ""for I can see you are not happy here! Do they live far off? Have you sufficient money for your journey? Forgive my asking!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22786",NA,"Miss Wynward stooped down and kissed the girl's brow.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22787",NA,"""Thank you so much for your kind thought, but it is unnecessary. You will be surprised perhaps,"" continued Miss Wynward, blushing, ""but I am going to be married.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22788",NA,"""And so am I,"" was on Harriet's lips, when she laid her head down on the lid of her trunk and began to cry anew. ""O! Miss Wynward, what did she mean? Can there be any truth in it? Is there something poisonous in my nature that harms those with whom I come in contact? How can it be? How can it be?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22789",NA,"""No! no! of course not!"" replied her friend, ""Cannot you see that it was the Baroness's temper that made her speak so cruelly to you? But you are right to go! Only, where are you going?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22790",NA,"""I do not know! I am so ignorant of London. Can you advise me?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22791",NA,"""You will communicate with your friends to morrow?"" asked Miss Wynward anxiously.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22792",NA,"""O! yes! as soon as I can!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22793",NA,"""Then I should go to the Langham Hotel in Portland Place for to-night at all events! There you will be safe till your friends advise you further. What can I do to help you?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22794",NA,"""Ask Sarah or William to fetch a cab! And to have my boxes placed on it! There is a douceur for them,"" said Harriet placing a handsome sum in Miss Wynward's hand.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22795",NA,"""And you will not see the Baroness again?"" asked her companion.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22796",NA,"""No! no! for God's sake, no. I could not trust myself! I can never look upon her face again!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22797",NA,"In a few minutes the hired vehicle rolled away from the door, bearing Harriet Brandt and her possessions to the Langham Hotel, and Miss Wynward returned to the room where Bobby lay. Madame Gobelli stood exactly where she had left her, gazing at the corpse. There were no tears in her eyes-only the continuous shaking of her huge limbs.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22798",NA,"""Come!"" said Miss Wynward, not unkindly, ""you had better sit down, and let me bring you a glass of wine! This terrible shock has been too much for you.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22799",NA,"But the Baroness only pushed her hand away impatiently.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22800",NA,"""Who was that driving away just now?"" she enquired.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22801",NA,"""Miss Brandt! You have driven her from the house with your cruel and unnecessary accusations. No one liked Bobby better than she did!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22802",NA,"""Has the doctor arrived?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22803",NA,"""I expect so! I hear the Baron's voice in the hall now!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22804",NA,"Almost as she spoke the Baron and the doctor entered the room. The medical man did what was required of him. He felt the heart and pulse of the corpse-turned back the eyelids-sighed professionally and asked how long it was since it had happened.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22805",NA,"He was told that it was about an hour since they had found him.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22806",NA,"""Ah! he has been dead longer than that! Three hours at the least, maybe four! I am afraid there must be an inquest, and it would be advisable in the interests of science to have a post mortem. A great pity, a fine grown lad-nineteen years old you say-shall probably detect hidden mischief in the heart and lungs. I will make all the necessary arrangements with the Baron. Good evening!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22807",NA,"And the doctor bowed himself out of sight again.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22808",NA,"""It is quite true then,"" articulated the Baroness thickly. ""He is gone!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22809",NA,"""O! yes my lady, he is gone, poor dear boy! I felt sure of that!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22810",NA,"""It is quite certain?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22811",NA,"""Quite certain! The body is already stiffening!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22812",NA,"The Baroness did not utter a sound but Miss Wynward, glancing at her, saw her body sway slowly backwards and forwards once or twice before it fell heavily to the ground, stricken with paralysis.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22813",NA,"- CHAPTER XVI -","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22814",NA,"Doctor Phillips was a great favourite with the beau sexe. He was so mild and courteous, so benevolent and sympathetic, that they felt sure he might be trusted with their little secrets. Women, both old and young, invaded his premises daily and therefore it was no matter of surprise to him when, whilst he was still occupied with his breakfast on the morning following Harriet Brandt's flight from the Red House, his confidential servant Charles announced that a young lady was waiting to see him in his consulting room.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22815",NA,"""No name, Charles?"" demanded the doctor.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22816",NA,"""No name, Sir!"" replied the discreet Charles, without the ghost of a smile.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22817",NA,"""Say that I will be with her in a minute!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22818",NA,"Doctor Phillips finished his cutlet and his coffee before he rose from table. He knew what ladies' confidences were like and that he should not have much chance of returning to finish an interrupted meal.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22819",NA,"But as he entered his consulting room his air of indifference changed to one of surprise. Pacing restlessly up and down the carpet was Harriet Brandt, but so altered that he should hardly have recognised her. Her face was puffy and swollen, as though she had wept all night; her eyelids, red and inflamed; her whole demeanour, wild and anxious.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22820",NA,"""My dear young lady-is it possible that I see Miss Brandt?"" the doctor began.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22821",NA,"She turned towards him and coming up close to his side, grasped his arm. ""I must speak to you!"" she exclaimed, without further preliminary, ""you are the only person who can set my doubts at rest.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22822",NA,"""Well! well! well!"" he said, soothingly, for the girl looked and spoke as though her mind were disordered. ""You may rely that I will do all I can for you! But let us sit down first!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22823",NA,"""No! no!"" cried Harriet, ""there is no time, I cannot rest; you must satisfy my mind at once or I shall go mad! I have not closed my eyes all night-the time was interminable, but how could I sleep? I seemed to be torn in pieces by ten thousand devils!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22824",NA,"""My dear child,"" said Doctor Phillips, as he laid his hand on hers and looked her steadily in the face, ""you are over-excited. You must try to restrain yourself.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22825",NA,"He went up to a side table and pouring out some cordial, made her drink it. Harriet gulped it down and sank back exhausted in a chair. She was weak and worn-out with the excitement she had passed through.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22826",NA,"""Come! that is better,"" said the doctor, as he saw the tears stealing from beneath her closed eyelids, ""now, don't hurry yourself! Keep quiet till you feel strong enough to speak and then tell me what it is that brings you here!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22827",NA,"The allusion appeared to stir up all her misery again. She sat upright and grasped the doctor by the arm as she had done at first.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22828",NA,"""You must tell me,"" she said breathlessly, ""you must tell me all I want to know. They say you knew my father and mother in Jamaica! Is that true!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22829",NA,"The old doctor began to feel uncomfortable. It is one thing to warn those in whom you are interested against a certain person, or persons, and another to be confronted with the individual you have spoken of, and forced to repeat your words. Yet Doctor Phillips was innocent of having misjudged, or slandered anyone.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22830",NA,"""I did know your father and mother-for a short time!"" he answered cautiously.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22831",NA,"""And were they married to each other?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22832",NA,"""My dear young lady, what is the use of dragging up such questions now? Your parents are both gone to their account-why not let all that concerned them rest also?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22833",NA,"""No! no! you forget that I live-to suffer the effects of their wrong-doing! I must know the truth-I will not leave the house until you tell me! Were they married? Am I a-a-bastard?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22834",NA,"""If you insist upon knowing, I believe they were not married-at least it was the general opinion in the Island. But would not Mr. Tarver be the proper person to inform you of anything which you may wish to know?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22835",NA,"Harriet seized his hand and carried it to her forehead-it was burning hot.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22836",NA,"""Feel that!"" she exclaimed, ""and you would have me wait for weeks before I could get any satisfaction from Mr. Tarver, and not then perhaps! Do you think I could live through the agony of suspense. I should kill myself before the answer to my letter came. No! you are the only person that can give me any satisfaction. Madame Gobelli told me to ask you for the truth, if I did not believe her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22837",NA,"""Madame Gobelli,"" reiterated the doctor in surprise.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22838",NA,"""Yes! I was staying with her at the Red House until last night and then she was so cruel to me that I left. Her son Bobby is dead and she accused me of having killed him. She said that my father was a murderer and my mother a negress-that they were both so wicked that their own servants killed them, and that I have inherited all their vices. She said that it was I who killed Mrs. Pullen's baby and that I had vampire blood in me and should poison everyone I came in contact with. What does she mean? Tell me the truth, for God's sake, for more depends upon it than you have any idea of.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22839",NA,"""Madame Gobelli was extremely wrong to speak in such a manner and I do not know on what authority she did so. What can she know of your parents or their antecedents?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22840",NA,"""But you-you-"" cried Harriet feverishly, ""what do you say?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22841",NA,"Doctor Phillips was silent. He did not know what to say. He was not a man who could tell a lie glibly and appear as if he were speaking the truth. Patients always guessed when he had no hope to give them, however soothing and carefully chosen his words might be. He regarded the distracted girl before him for some moments in compassionate silence, and then he answered:","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22842",NA,"""I have said already that if a daughter cannot hear any good of her parents she had better hear nothing at all!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

"22844",NA,"""The purity and charity of your own life can do much to wipe out the stain upon theirs,"" said the doctor. ""You have youth and money and the opportunity of doing good. You may be as beloved as they were--""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22845",NA,"""Hated,"" interposed the girl, ""I understand you perfectly! But what about my possessing the fatal power of injuring those I come in contact with! What truth is there in that? Answer me, for God's sake! Have I inherited the vampire's blood? Who bequeathed to me that fatal heritage?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22846",NA,"""My dear Miss Brandt, you must not talk of such a thing! You are alluding only to a superstition!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22847",NA,"""But have I got it, whatever it may be?"" persisted Harriet. ""Had I anything to do with the baby's death, or with that of Bobby Bates? I loved them both! Was it my love that killed them? Shall I always kill everybody I love? I must know-I will!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22848",NA,"""Miss Brandt, you have now touched upon a subject that is little thought of or discussed amongst medical men, but that is undoubtedly true. The natures of persons differ very widely. There are some born into this world who nourish those with whom they are associated; they give out their magnetic power and their families, their husbands or wives, children and friends, feel the better for it. There are those, on the other hand, who draw from their neighbours, sometimes making large demands upon their vitality-sapping their physical strength and feeding upon them, as it were, until they are perfectly exhausted and unable to resist disease. This proclivity has been likened to that of the vampire bat who is said to suck the breath of its victims. And it was doubtless to this fable that Madame Gobelli alluded when speaking to you.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22849",NA,"""But have I got it? Have I got it?"" the girl demanded, eagerly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22850",NA,"The doctor looked at her lustrous glowing eyes, at her parted feverish lips; at the working hands clasped together; the general appearance of excited sensuality, and thought it was his duty to warn her at least a little against the dangers of indulging such a temperament as she unfortunately possessed. But like all medical men he temporised.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22851",NA,"""I should certainly say that your temperament was more of the drawing than the yielding order, Miss Brandt, but that is not your fault you know. It is a natural organism. But I think it is my duty to warn you that you are not likely to make those with whom you intimately associate stronger either in mind or body. You will always exert a weakening and debilitating effect upon them so that after a while, having sapped their brains and lowered the tone of their bodies, you will find their affection, or friendship for you visibly decrease. You will have, in fact, sucked them dry. So, if I may venture to advise you I would say, if there is any one person in the world whom you most desire to benefit and retain the affection of, let that be the very person from whom you separate as often as possible. You must never hope to keep anyone near you for long, without injuring them. Make it your rule through life never to cleave to any one person altogether, or you will see that person's interest in you wax and wane until it is destroyed!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22852",NA,"""And what if I-marry?"" asked Harriet, in a strained voice.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22853",NA,"""If you insist upon my answering that question, I should advise you seriously not to marry! I do not think yours is a temperament fitted for married life, nor likely to be happy in it! You will not be offended by my plain speaking, I hope. Remember, you have forced it from me!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22854",NA,"""And that is the truth, medically and scientifically-that I must not marry?"" she repeated, dully.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22855",NA,"""I think it would be unadvisable, but everyone must judge for himself in such matters. But marriage is not, after all, the ultimatum of earthly bliss, Miss Brandt! Many married couples would tell you it is just the reverse. And with a fortune at your command you have many pleasures and interests quite apart from that very over-rated institution of matrimony. But don't think I am presuming to do more than advise you. There is no real reason-medical or legal- why you should not choose for yourself in the matter!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22856",NA,"""Only-only-that those I cling to most nearly will suffer from the contact,"" said Harriet in the same strained tones.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22857",NA,"""Just so!"" responded the doctor, gaily, ""and an old man's advice to you is to keep out of it as he has done! And now-if there is anything more,"" he continued, ""that I can do for you--""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22858",NA,"""Nothing more, thank you,"" replied the girl rising, ""I understand it all now!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22859",NA,"""Will you not see your old friend, Mrs. Pullen, before you go?"" asked the doctor. ""She and her husband are staying with me!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

"22861",NA,"And she hurried from the consulting room as she spoke.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22862",NA,"Doctor Phillips stood for awhile musing after her departure. Had he done right he thought, in telling her, yet how in the face of persistent questioning could he have done otherwise? His thoughts were all fixed upon Ralph Pullen and the scenes that had taken place lately with him respecting this girl. He did not dream she had an interest in Anthony Pennell. He did not know that they had met more than once. He thought she might still be pursuing Ralph; still expecting that he might break his engagement with Miss Leyton in order to marry herself; and he believed he had done the wisest thing in trying to crush any hopes she might have left concerning him.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22863",NA,"""A most dangerous temperament,"" he said to himself, as he prepared to receive another patient, ""one that is sufficient to mar a man's life, if not to kill him entirely. I trust that she and Captain Pullen may never meet again. It was evident that my remarks on marriage disappointed the poor child! Ah! well, she will be much better without it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22864",NA,"And here the discreet Charles softly opened the door and ushered in another lady.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22865",NA,"An hour later Anthony Pennell, who had projected a visit to the Red House that afternoon, received a note by a commissionaire instead containing a few hurried lines. ""Come to me as soon as you can,"" it said, ""I have left Madame Gobelli. I am at the Langham Hotel and very unhappy!"" Needless to say that ten minutes after the reception of this news her lover was rushing to her presence, as fast as hansom wheels could take him.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22866",NA,"He was very desperately and truly in love with Harriet Brandt. Like most men who use their brains in fiction, his work whilst in course of progression, occupied his energies to such an extent that he had no time or thought for anything else. But the burden once lifted; the romance written; the strain and anxiety removed, the pendulum swung in the other direction and Anthony Pennell devoted all his attention to pleasure and amusement. He had been set down by his colleagues as a reserved and cold-blooded man with regard to the other sex, but he was only self-contained and thoughtful. He was as warm by nature as Harriet herself, and once sure of a response could make love with the best, and as he flew to her assistance now he resolved that if anything unpleasant had occurred to drive her from the Red House and launch her friendless on the world, he would persuade her to marry him at once and elect him her protector and defence.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22867",NA,"His fair face flushed with anticipation as he thought of the joy it would be to make her his wife and take her far away from everything that could annoy or harass her.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22868",NA,"Having arrived at the Langham and flung a double fare to the cab driver he ran up the high staircase with the light step of a boy, and dashed into Harriet's private room. The girl was sitting, much as she had done since returning from her interview with the doctor- silent, sullen, and alone, at war with Heaven and Destiny and all that had conduced to blight the brightest hopes she had ever had.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22869",NA,"""Hally, my darling, why is this?"" exclaimed Pennell, as he essayed to fold her in his arms. But she pushed him off, not unkindly but with considerable determination.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22870",NA,"""Don't touch me, Tony!-don't come near me. You had better not! I might harm you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

"22872",NA,"""No! no! you do not understand!"" replied Harriet, as she rose from her seat and edged further away from him, ""but I am going to tell you all! It is for that I sent for you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22873",NA,"Then, waving him from her with her hand, she related the whole story to him-what the Baroness had accused her of and what Doctor Phillips had said in confirmation of it only that morning. Pennell had heard something of it before, through Margaret Pullen, but he had paid no attention to it and now, when Harriet repeated it in detail with swollen eyes and quivering lips, he laughed the idea to scorn.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22874",NA,"""Pooh! Nonsense! I don't believe a word of it,"" he exclaimed, ""it is a parcel of old women's tales. Phillips should be ashamed of himself to place any credence in it, far more to repeat it to you! Hally, my darling! you are surely not going to make yourself unhappy because of such nonsense. If so, you are not the sensible girl I have taken you for!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22875",NA,"""But, Tony,"" said the girl, still backing from his advances, ""listen to me! It is not all nonsense, indeed. I know for myself that it is true! Having been shut up for so many years in the Convent dulled my memory for what went before it, but it has all come back to me now! It seems as if what Madame Gobelli and Doctor Phillips have said had lifted a veil from my eyes, and I can recall things that had quite escaped my memory before. I can remember now hearing old Pete say that when I was born I was given to a black wet nurse and after a little while she was taken so ill they had to send her away and get me another, and the next one-died! Pete used to laugh and call me the puma's cub, but I didn't know the meaning of it then. And-O! stop a moment, Tony, till I have done-there was a little white child, I can see her so plainly now. They called her little Caroline, I think she must have belonged to the planter who lived next to us, and I was very fond of her. I was quite unhappy when we did not meet and I used to creep into her nursery door and lie down in the cot beside her. Poor little Caroline! I can see her now! So pale and thin and wan she was! And one night, I remember her mother came in and found me there and called to her husband to send the 'Brandt bastard' back to Helvetia. I had no idea what she meant but I cried because she sent me home, and I asked Pete what a bastard was, but he would not tell me. And,"" went on Harriet in a scared tone, ""little Caroline died! Pete carried me on his shoulder to see the funeral and I would not believe that Caroline could be in that narrow box, and I struck Pete on the face for saying so!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22876",NA,"""Well! my darling! and if you did, are these childish reminiscences to come between our happiness? Why should they distress you, Hally? Madame Gobelli's insolence must have been very hard to bear-I acknowledge that, and I wish I had been by to prevent it, but you must make excuses for her. I suppose the poor creature was so mad with grief that she did not know what she was saying! But you need never see her again, so you must try to forgive her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22877",NA,"""But, Anthony, you do not understand me! What the Baroness said was true! I see it now! I killed Bobby!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22878",NA,"""My dearest, you are raving! You killed Bobby! What utter, utter folly! How could you have killed Bobby?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22879",NA,"Harriet passed her hand wearily across her brow, as if she found it too hard to make her meaning plain.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22880",NA,"""O! yes, I did! We were always together, in the garden or the house! And he used to sit with his head on my shoulder and his arm round my waist. I should not have allowed it! I should have driven him away! But he loved me, poor Bobby, and it will be the same, Doctor Phillips says, with everybody I love! I shall only do them harm!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22881",NA,"""Hally! I shall begin to think in another moment that you are ill yourself-that you have a fever or something and that it is affecting your brain!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22882",NA,"""There was a sister at the Convent, Sister Theodosia, who was very good to me when I first went there,"" continued the girl in a dreamy voice, as if she had not heard his words; ""and she used to sit with me upon her lap for hours together because I was sad. But she grew ill and they had to send her away up to the hill where they had their sanatorium. That made the fourth in Jamaica!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22883",NA,"""Now! I will not have you talk any more of this nonsense,"" said Pennell, half annoyed by her perseverance, ""and to prove to you what a little silly you are to imagine that everyone who falls ill or dies, who comes within the range of your acquaintance owes it to your influence, tell me how it is that your father and mother, who must have lived nearer to you than anybody else, did not fall sick and die also?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22884",NA,"""My parents saw less of me than anybody,"" replied Harriet, sadly, ""they were ashamed of their 'bastard' I suppose! But old Pete loved me and took me with him everywhere, and he didn't get sick,"" she concluded, with a faint smile.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22885",NA,"""Of course not! See! what rubbish you have been talking-making yourself and me unhappy for nothing at all! So now let me take you in my arms and kiss the remembrance of it away!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

"22890",NA,"""I must part from you,"" replied the girl, ""indeed, indeed I must! I cannot injure you as I have done others! Doctor Phillips said I was not fit for marriage-that I should always weaken and hurt those whom I loved most-and that I should draw from them, physically and mentally until I had sapped all their strength-that I have the blood of the vampire in me, the vampire that sucks its victims' breaths until they die!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22891",NA,"""Doctor Phillips be damned!"" exclaimed Pennell, ""what right has he to promulgate his absurd and untenable theories, and to poison the happiness of a girl's life with his folly? He is an old fool, a dotard, a senseless ass, and I shall tell him so! Vampire be hanged! And if it were the truth, I for one could not wish for a sweeter death! Come along, Hally, and try your venom upon me! I am quite ready to run the risk!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22892",NA,"He held out his arms to her again as he spoke, and she sank on her knees beside him.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"

I did not know that it was given to mortals to love so much! And my love has opened my eyes! Sooner than injure you, whom I would die to save from harm, I will separate myself from you! I will give you up! I will live my lonely life without you.

I thought it the best way to put all idea of catching Captain Pullen out of her mind. Let him once get safely married and she can decide for herself with regard to the next.

"22938",NA,"""O! no! no! I am not in the least afraid! Why should she? I shall only tell her how much I feel for her-how much our common loss--""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22939",NA,"She could not proceed, and the doctor whispered to the Colonel, ""Let her do as she wishes! The best salve for our own wounds is to try and heal those of others!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22940",NA,"Margaret rose and prepared to leave the room.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22941",NA,"""I shall go at once,"" she said. ""I suppose there is no chance of my meeting Harriet Brandt there!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22942",NA,"""I think not! She told me she had left the Red House for good and all, but she did not say where she was staying! Though, after all, I think she is most in want of comfort of the two.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22943",NA,"""O! no!"" replied Margaret, faintly, ""there is no grief like that of-of-"" She did not finish her sentence but left the room hastily in order to assume her walking things.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22944",NA,"""Will she ever get over the loss of her child?"" demanded Colonel Pullen, gloomily. The doctor regarded him with a half-amused surprise.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22945",NA,"""My dear fellow, though it is useless to preach the doctrine to a bereaved mother, the loss of an innocent baby is perhaps the least trying in the category of human ills. To rear the child, as thousands do, to be unloving, or unsympathetic, or ungrateful, is a thousand times worse. But it is too soon for your dear wife to acknowledge it! Let her go to this other mother and let them cry together. It will do her all the good in the world!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22946",NA,"And the doctor, having finished his luncheon, put on his top coat and prepared to make a round of professional calls.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22947",NA,"Margaret came back ready for her visit.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22948",NA,"""I shall not offer to go with you, darling,"" said the Colonel, ""because my presence would only be inconvenient. But mind you keep the cab waiting, or you may find some difficulty in getting another in that district. What address shall I give the driver?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22949",NA,"""First to our florist in Regent Street, that I may get some white flowers.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22950",NA,"In another minute she was off, and in about an hour afterwards she found herself outside the Red House which looked gloomier than ever with all the blinds drawn down. Margaret rang the front door bell which was answered by Miss Wynward.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22951",NA,"""Can I see Madame Gobelli?"" commenced Margaret, ""I have just heard the sad news and come to condole with her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22952",NA,"Miss Wynward let her into the hall and ushered her into a side room.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22953",NA,"""You will excuse my asking if you are a friend of her ladyship's,"" she said.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22954",NA,"""I can hardly call myself a friend,"" replied Margaret, ""but I stayed with her in the same hotel at Heyst last summer, and I knew the dear boy who is dead. I was most grieved to hear of his death, and naturally anxious to enquire after the Baroness. But if she is too upset to see me, of course I would not think of forcing my presence upon her!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22955",NA,"""I don't think her ladyship would object to receiving any friend, but I am not sure if she would recognise you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22956",NA,"""Not recognise me? It is not three months since we parted.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22957",NA,"""You do not understand me! Our dear boy's death was so sudden-I have been with him since he was five years old, so you will forgive my mentioning him in such a fashion-that it has had a terrible effect upon his poor mother. In fact she is paralysed! The medical men think the paralysis is confined to the lower limbs, but at present they are unable to decide definitely as the Baroness has not opened her lips since the event occurred.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22958",NA,"""O! poor Madame Gobelli!"" cried Margaret, tearfully, ""I felt sure she loved him under all her apparent roughness and indifference!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22959",NA,"""Yes! I have been with them so long that I know her manner amounted at times to cruelty, but she did not mean it to be so! She thought to make him hardy and independent, instead of which it had just the opposite effect! But she is paying bitterly for it now! I really think his death will kill her, though the doctors laugh at my fears!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22960",NA,"""I-I-too have lost my only child, my precious little baby,"" replied Margaret, encouraged by the sympathetic tenderness in the other woman's eyes, ""and I thought also at first that I must die-that I could not live without her-but God is so good, and there is such comfort in the thought that what ever we may suffer, our darlings have missed all the bitterness and sin and disappointments of this world, that at last-that is, sometimes-one feels almost thankful that they are safe with Him!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22961",NA,"""Ah! Madame Gobelli has not your hope and trust, Madam!"" said Miss Wynward, ""if she had, she would be a better and happier woman. But I must tell you that she is in the same room as Bobby! She will not be moved from there, but lies on the couch where we placed her when she fell, stricken with the paralysis, gazing at the corpse!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22962",NA,"""Poor dear woman!"" exclaimed Margaret.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22963",NA,"""Perhaps you would hardly care to go into that room!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22964",NA,"""O! I should like it! I want to see the dear boy again! I have brought some flowers to put over him!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22965",NA,"""Then what name shall I tell her ladyship?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22966",NA,"""Mrs. Pullen, say Margaret Pullen whose little baby died at Heyst-then I think she will remember!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22967",NA,"""Will you take a seat, Mrs. Pullen, whilst I go upstairs and see if I can persuade her to receive you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22968",NA,"Margaret sat down and Miss Wynward went up to the chamber which had once been Bobby's. On the bed was stretched the body of the dead boy, whilst opposite to it, lay on a couch, a woman with dry eyes but palsied limbs staring, staring without intermission, at the silent figure which had once contained the spirit of her son. She did not turn her head as Miss Wynward entered the room.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22969",NA,"""My lady,"" she said, going up to her, ""Mrs. Pullen is downstairs and would like to see you! She told me to say that she is Margaret Pullen whose baby died in Heyst last summer, and she knew Bobby and has brought some flowers to strew over his bed. May she come up?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22970",NA,"But she received no answer. Madame Gobelli's features were working, but that was the only sign of life which she gave.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22971",NA,"""Mrs. Pullen is so very sorry for your loss,"" Miss Wynward went on, ""she cried when she spoke of it, and as she has suffered the same, I am sure she will sympathise with you. May I say that you will see her?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22972",NA,"Still there was no response, and Miss Wynward went down again to Margaret.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22973",NA,"""I think you had better come up without waiting for her consent,"" she said, ""if seeing you roused her, even to anger, it would do her good. Do you mind making the attempt?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22974",NA,"""No,"" replied Margaret, ""but if the Baroness gets very angry, you must let me run away again. I am quite unequal to standing anything like a scene!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22975",NA,"""You will have but to quit the room. What ever her ladyship may say she cannot move from her couch. She attacked poor Miss Brandt most unwarrantably last evening, but that was in the first frenzy of her grief. She is quite different now!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22976",NA,"""Poor woman!"" again ejaculated Margaret, as she followed Miss Wynward, not without some inward qualms, to the presence of Madame Gobelli. But when she caught sight of the immovable figure on the couch, all her fear and resentment left her, overcome by a mighty compassion. She went straight up to the Baroness and bending down tenderly kissed her twitching face.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22977",NA,"""Dear Madame,"" she said, ""I am-we all are-so truly sorry for your grievous loss. It reminds me of the bitter time, not so long ago you may remember, when I lost my darling little Ethel and thought for the while that my life was over! It is so hard, so unnatural, to us poor mothers to see our children go before ourselves! I can weep with you tear for tear! But do remember-try to remember-that he is safe-that though you remain here with empty arms for awhile, death can no more take your boy from you than a veil over your face can take God's light from you. He is there, dear Madame Gobelli-just in the next room with the door closed between you, and though I know full well how bitter it is to see the door closed, think of the time when it will open again-when you and I will spring through it and find, not only our dear Bobby and Ethel, but Christ our Lord, ready to give them back into our arms again!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22978",NA,"The Baroness said nothing, but two tears gathered in her eyes and rolled down her flabby cheeks. Margaret turned from her for a minute and walking up to the bed, knelt down beside it in prayer.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22979",NA,"""Dear Christ!"" she said, ""You Who know what our mothers' hearts are called upon to bear, have pity on us and give us Thy Peace! And open our eyes that we may gather strength to realise what our dear children have escaped by being taken home to Thee-the sin, the trouble, the anxiety, the disappointment-and make us thankful to bear them in their stead, and give us grace to look forward to our happy meeting and reunion in the Better Land.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22980",NA,"Then she rose and bent over the dead boy.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22981",NA,"""Dear Bobby!"" she murmured, as she kissed the cold brow and placed the white blossoms in his hands and round his head. ""Good-bye! I know how happy you must be now, in company with the spirits of all those whom we have loved and who have gone home before us-how grateful you must feel to the dear Redeemer Who has called you so early-but don't forget your poor mother upon earth! Pray for her, Bobby-never cease to ask our dear Lord to send her comfort and peace and joy in believing. For His own dear sake. Amen!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22982",NA,"When she turned again the Baroness's cheeks were wet with tears and she was stretching forth her arms towards her.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22983",NA,"""O!"" she gasped, as Margaret reached her side, ""I am a godless woman-I am a godless woman!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22984",NA,"""No! no! my dear friend, we are none of us godless,"" replied Margaret, ""we may think we are, but God knows better! We may forsake Him, but He never forsakes us! We should never be saved if we waited till we wanted to be so. It is He Who wants us-that is our great safeguard! He wanted our two dear children-not to spite us, but to draw us after them. Try to look at it in that light and then Bobby's death will prove your greatest gain.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22985",NA,"""I am a godless woman,"" repeated the Baroness, ""and this is my punishment!"" pointing to the bed, ""I loved him best of all! My 'eart is broken!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22986",NA,"""So much the better, if it was a hard heart,"" rejoined Margaret, smiling. ""Who was it that said, 'If your heart is broken, give the pieces to Christ and He will mend it again'? Never think of Bobby, dear Madame Gobelli, except as with Christ-walking with Him, talking with Him, learning of Him and growing in grace and the love of God daily! Never disassociate the two memories, and in a little while you would hate yourself if you could separate them again. God bless you! I must go back to my husband now!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22987",NA,"""You will come again?"" said the Baroness.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22988",NA,"""I am afraid I shall have no time! We sail for India on Saturday, but I shall not forget you. Good-bye Bobby,"" she repeated, with a last look at the corpse, ""remember your mother and me in your prayers.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22989",NA,"As Miss Wynward let her out of the Red House she remarked, ""I could never have believed that anyone could have had so much influence over her ladyship as you have, Mrs. Pullen. I hope you will come again.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22990",NA,"""I shall not be able to do so. But Madame Gobelli will have you to talk to her! You live here altogether, do you not?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22991",NA,"""I have lived here for many years, but I am on the point of leaving. Bobby was my only tie to the Red House, or I should have gone long ago.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22992",NA,"""But now that the Baroness is so helpless surely you will delay your departure until she no longer needs you.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22993",NA,"""I shall not leave her until she has secured a better woman in my stead. But to tell you the truth, I am going to be married, Mrs. Pullen, and I consider my first duty is towards my future husband and his parents who are very old!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22994",NA,"""O! doubtless! May I ask his name?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22995",NA,"""Captain Hill! He lives in the next house to this-Stevenage! You are surprised, perhaps, that a man who has been in the army should marry a poor governess like myself. That is his goodness. I know that I am worn and faded and no longer young-thirty-three on my last birthday-but he is good enough to care for me all the more for the troubles I have passed through. Mine has been a chequered life, Mrs. Pullen, but I have told Captain Hill everything and he still wishes to make me his wife! I ought to be a happy woman for the future, ought I not?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22996",NA,"""Indeed yes,"" said Margaret, heartily, ""and I sincerely hope that you may be so! But I can't help thinking of poor Madame Gobelli! Is the Baron good to her?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22997",NA,"""Pretty well!"" answered Miss Wynward, ""but he is very stolid and unsympathetic! It is strange to think that her heart must have been bound up in that boy, and yet at times she was positively cruel to him!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22998",NA,"""It has all been permitted for some good purpose,"" said Margaret, as she bade her farewell, ""perhaps her remorse and self-accusation are the only things which would have brought her down upon her knees.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"22999",NA,"She returned home considerably saddened by what she had seen, but in three days she was to accompany her husband to India and in the bustle of preparation, and the joy of knowing that she was not to be separated from him again, her heart was comforted and at peace. Never once during that time did she give one thought to Harriet Brandt. Miss Wynward had hardly mentioned her name, and no one seemed to know where she had gone. The girl had passed out of their lives altogether.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23000",NA,"Margaret only regretted one thing in leaving England-that she had not seen Anthony Pennell again. Colonel Pullen had called twice at his chambers, but had each time found him from home.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23001",NA,"Margaret wanted to put in a good word for the Baroness with him. She thought perhaps that he might see her, after awhile, and speak a few words of comfort to her. But she was obliged to be content with writing her wishes in a farewell letter. She little knew how hardened Anthony Pennell felt, at that moment, against anyone who had treated the woman he loved in so harsh a manner.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23002",NA,"Harriet Brandt spent the time, after her lover had left her to think over and decide upon their mutual fate, in walking up and down the room. She was like a restless animal; she could not stay two moments in the same place. Even when night fell and the inhabitants of the Langham Hotel had retired to rest, she still kept pacing up and down the room, without thinking of undressing herself or seeking repose, whilst her conscience wrestled in warfare with her inclinations. Her thoughts took her far, far back to the earliest remembrance of which her mind was capable. She thought of her hard, unfeeling, indifferent father-of her gross, flabby sensual mother-and shuddered at the remembrance! What had she done?-she said to herself-wherein had she sinned, that she should have been cursed with such progenitors? How had they dared to bring her into the world, an innocent yet hapless child of sin-the inheritor of their evil propensities-of their lust, their cruelty, their sensuality, their gluttony-and worst of all, the fatal heritage that made her a terror and a curse to her fellow-creatures? How dared they? How dared they? Why had God's ven-geance not fallen upon them before they had completed their cruel work, or having accomplished it, why did He not let her perish with them-so that the awful power with which they had imbued her might have been prevented from harming others?","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23003",NA,"Harriet thought of little Caroline; of her two nurses; of Sister Theodosia; of Mrs. Pullen's baby; of Bobby Bates; until she felt as though she should go mad. No! no! she would never bring that curse upon her Beloved; he must go far away, he must never see her again, or else she would destroy herself in order that he might escape!","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23004",NA,"But if she persuaded Anthony to consent to her wishes-if she insisted upon a total separation between them, what would become of her? What should she do? She had no friends in England; Madame Gobelli had turned against her-she was all alone! She would live and die alone. How should she ever get to know people, or to obtain an entrance to Society? She would be a pariah to the end of her life!","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23005",NA,"And if she did surmount all these obstacles, what would be the result except a repetition of what had gone before? Strangers would come to know her-to like her-would grow more intimate and she would respond to their kindness-with the same result. They would droop and fail, die perhaps, like Bobby and the baby-find out that she was the cause and shun her ever after.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23006",NA,"""O! God!"" cried Harriet in her perplexity and anguish, ""I am accursed! My parents have made me not fit to live!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23007",NA,"She passed that night through the agonies of Death-not the death that overtakes the believer in a God and a Future-but the darkness and uncertainty that enwrap the man who knows he is full of sin and yet has no knowledge that His Lord has paid his debt to the uttermost farthing-the doubt and anxiety that beset the unbeliever when he is called upon to enter the dark Valley. The poor child saw her destiny entangling her as in a net-she longed to break through it, but saw no means of escape-and she rebelled against the cruel lot that heredity had marked out for her.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23008",NA,"""Why am I to suffer?"" she exclaimed aloud; ""I have youth and health and good looks, and money-everything, the world would say, calculated to make my life a pleasant one, and yet I am tortured by this awful thought-that I must keep aloof from everybody, that I am a social leper, full of contagion and death! Doctor Phillips said that the more I loved a person, the more I must keep away from him! It is incredible! unheard of! Could he have had any motive in saying such a thing?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23009",NA,"The remembrance of her flirtation with Ralph Pullen recurred to her mind, and she seized it as a drowning man clutches at a straw.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23010",NA,"""Was it a plant, after all? Did the old man want to put me off the track of Captain Pullen? Margaret Pullen is staying in the house-he said so-had she asked him to get rid of me if possible? After all, am I torturing myself by believing the story of my fatal power to be true when it was only a ruse to get rid of me? The Baroness said the same thing, but she was mad about poor Bobby and would have said anything to annoy me-and, after all, what does it amount to? The baby died in teething-heaps of babies do-and Bobby was consumptive from the first-I have heard Miss Wynward say so, and would have died anyway as he grew to be a man and had larger demands made upon his physical strength. And for the others-what happened to them happens to all the world. It is fortune de la guerre; people drop every day like rotten sheep;-everyone might accuse himself of causing the death of his neighbour. I have been frightening myself with a chimera. Anthony said so, and he must know better than I! And I can't give up Tony-I can't, I can't, I can't! It is of no use thinking of it! Besides, he wouldn't let me! He would never leave me alone until I had consented to marry him, so I may as well do it at the first as at the last.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23011",NA,"But the tide of triumphant feeling would be succeeded by a wave of despondency, which threatened to upset all her casuistry.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23012",NA,"""But if-if-it should be true, and Anthony should-should-O! God! O! God! I dare not think of it! I will kill myself before it shall occur.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23013",NA,"When the morning dawned it found her quite undecided-lamenting her unfortunate fate one instant, and declaring that she could never give up her lover the next. She tore off her clothes and took a cold bath and re-robed herself, but she was looking utterly ill and exhausted when Pennell burst in upon her at eleven o'clock.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23014",NA,"""Well, darling,"" he exclaimed, ""and have you made up your mind by this time? Which death am I to die?-suffocated in your dear embrace, or left to perish of cold and hunger outside?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23015",NA,"""O! Tony,"" she cried, throwing herself into his arms, ""I don't know what to say! I have not closed my eyes all night trying to decide what will be for the best. And I am as far off as ever-only I can never, never consent to do anything that shall work you harm!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23016",NA,"""Then I shall decide for you,"" exclaimed her lover, ""and that is that you make me and yourself happy, and forget all the rubbish these people have been telling you! Depend upon it, whatever they may have said was for their own gratification and not yours, and that they would be quick enough to accept the lot that lies before you, were it in their power!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23017",NA,"""I have been so lonely and friendless all my life,"" said Harriet, sobbing in his arms, ""and I have longed for love and sympathy so much, and now that they have come to me it is hard, O! so hard, to have to give them up.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23018",NA,"""So hard, Hally, for me remember, as well as yourself, that we will not make the attempt. Now, I want you to place yourself in my hands and start for Paris to-night!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23019",NA,"""To-night?"" she cried, lifting such a flushed, startled, happy face from his breast, that he had no alternative but to kiss it again.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23020",NA,"""Yes, to-night! What did I tell you yesterday-that I should come with the ring and the license in my pocket! I am as good as my word and better-for I have given notice to the registrar of marriages in my district that he is to be ready for us at twelve o'clock to-day. Am I not a good manager?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23021",NA,"""Tony! Tony! but I have not made up my mind!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23022",NA,"""I have made it up for you and I will take no refusal! I have calculated it all to a nicety! Married at twelve-back here at one for lunch-a couple of hours to pack up, and off by the four o'clock train for Dover-sleep at the Castle Warden, and cross to-morrow to Paris! How will that do, Mrs. Pennell, eh?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23023",NA,"""O! ought I to do it, ought I to do it?"" exclaimed Harriet, with a look of despair.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23024",NA,"""If you don't I'll shoot myself. I swear it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23025",NA,"""No! no! darling, don't say that! It is of you alone that I am thinking! God forgive me if I am doing wrong, but I feel that I cannot refuse you! Take me and do with me as you think best.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23026",NA,"After which it came to pass that Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Pennell started in very high spirits for Dover by the four o'clock train that afternoon.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23027",NA,"- CHAPTER XVIII -","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23028",NA,"A fortnight afterwards the married couple found themselves at Nice. Much as has been said and sung of the lune de miel,[130] none ever surpassed, if it ever reached this one in happiness. Harriet passed the time in a silent ecstasy of delight. Her cup of bliss was filled to overflowing; her satisfaction was too deep for words. To this girl, for whom the world had been seen as yet, only through the barred windows of a convent-who had never enjoyed the society of an intellectual companion before; who had viewed no scenery but that of the Island; seen no records of the past; and visited no foreign capital; the first weeks of her married life were a panorama of novelties, her days one long astonishment and delight.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23029",NA,"She could not adore Anthony Pennell sufficiently for having afforded her the opportunity of seeing all this, and more especially of feeling it. The presents he lavished upon her were as nothing in her eyes compared to the lover-like attentions he paid her; the bouquets of flowers he brought her every morning; the glass of lemonade or milk he had ready to supply her need when they were taking their excursions; the warm shawl or mantle he carried on his arm in the evenings lest the air should become too chilly for her delicate frame after sunset. Money Harriet had no need of, but love-love she had thirsted for, as the hart thirsts for the water streams, yet had never imagined it could be poured out at her feet as her husband poured it now.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23030",NA,"And Pennell, on the other hand, though he had been much sought after and flattered by the fair sex for the sake of the fame he had acquired and the money he made, had never lost his heart to any woman as he had done to his little unknown wife. He had never met anyone like Hally before. She combined the intelligence of the Englishwoman with the espièglerie of the French-the devotion of the Creole with the fiery passion of the Spanish or Italian. He could conceive her quite capable of dying silently and uncomplainingly for him, or anyone she loved; or on the other hand stabbing her lover without remorse if roused by jealousy or insult.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23031",NA,"He was hourly discovering new traits in her character which delighted him because they were so utterly unlike any possessed by the women of the world with whom he had hitherto associated. He felt as though he had captured some beautiful wild creature and was taming it for his own pleasure.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23032",NA,"Harriet would sit for hours at a time in profound silence, contemplating his features or watching his actions-crouched on the floor at his feet until he was fain to lay down his book or writing and take to fondling her instead. She was an ever constant joy to him; he felt it would be impossible to do anything to displease her so long as he loved her-that like the patient Griselda[131] she would submit to any injustice and meekly call it justice if from his hand. And yet he knew all the while that the savage in her was not tamed-that at any moment, like the domesticated lion or tiger, her nature might assert itself and become furious, wild and intractable. It was the very uncertainty that pleased him; men love the women of whom they are not quite certain all the more. From Nice they wandered to Mentone but the proximity of the Monte Carlo tables had no charm for Anthony Pennell. He was not a speculating man: his brain was filled with better things and he only visited such places for the sake of reproduction. Although the autumn was now far advanced, the air of Mentone was too enervating to suit either of them, and Pennell proposed that they should move on to Italy.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23033",NA,"""I must shew you Venice and Rome before we return home, Hally,"" he said, ""and when I come to think of it, why should we return to England at all just yet? Why not winter in Rome? Richards is always advising me to take a good, long holiday. He says I overwork my brain and it reacts upon my body-what better opportunity could we find to adopt his advice? Hitherto I have pooh-poohed the idea! Wandering over a foreign country in solitary grandeur held no charms for me but with you, my darling, to double the pleasure of every thing, any place assumes the appearance of Paradise! What do you say, little wife? Shall we set up our tent South until the spring?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23034",NA,"""Don't you feel well, Tony?"" asked Harriet, anxiously.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23035",NA,"""Never better in my life, dear! I am afraid you will not make an interesting invalid out of me. I am as fit as a fiddle. But I fancy my next novel will deal with Italy and I should like to make a few notes of the spots I may require to introduce. It is nothing to take me away from you, darling. We will inspect the old places together, and your quick eye and clear brain shall help me in my researches. Is it a settled thing, Hally?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23036",NA,"""O! yes, darling!"" she replied, ""anywhere with you! The only place I shall ever object to will be the one where I cannot go with you.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23037",NA,"""That place does not exist on this earth, Hally,"" said Pennell, ""but if you are willing we may as well start to-morrow, for if we leave it too late we shall find all the best winter quarters pre-engaged.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23038",NA,"He left the room, as she thought rather hurriedly, but as he gained the hotel corridor he slightly staggered and leaned against the wall. He had told his wife that he was quite well, but he knew it was not the truth. He had felt weak and enervated ever since coming to Mentone, but he ascribed it to the soft mild atmosphere.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23039",NA,"""Confound this dizziness!"" he said inwardly, as the corridor swam before his eyes, ""I think my liver must be out of order, and yet I have been taking plenty of exercise. It must be this mild moist air. Heat never did agree with me. I shall be glad to get on. We shall find Florence cold by comparison.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23040",NA,"He descended to the bureau and announced his intention of giving up his rooms on the morrow, and then ordered a carriage and returned to take Hally out for a drive.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23041",NA,"In Florence they procured rooms in a grand old palazzo, furnished with rococo chairs and tables placed upon marble floors. Harriet was charmed and astonished by the ease with which they got everything en route, as though they possessed Aladin's lamp, she told Pennell, and had but to wish to obtain.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23042",NA,"""Ah! Hally!"" said her husband, ""we have some thing better than the genie's lamp-we have money! That is the true magician in this century. I am very thankful that you have a fortune of your own, my dearest, because I know that whatever happens, my girl will be able to hold her own with the world!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23043",NA,"Harriet grew pale.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23044",NA,"""What could happen?"" she stammered.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23045",NA,"""My silly little goose, are we immortal?"" he replied, ""I make a first-rate income, my dear, but have not laid by enough as yet to leave you more than comfortably off, but with your own money.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23046",NA,"""Don't speak of it, pray don't speak of it!"" she exclaimed, with ashen lips, and noting her distress, Pennell changed the subject.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23047",NA,"""You are a lucky little woman,"" he continued, ""I wonder what some people would give to possess your income-poor Margaret Pullen for instance.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23048",NA,"""Why Mrs. Pullen in particular, Tony? Are they poor?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23049",NA,"""Not whilst Colonel Pullen is on active service, but he has nothing but his pay to depend upon and whilst he can work, he must. Which means a residence in India and perhaps separation from his wife and children-if he should lose his health, a compulsory retirement; and if he keeps it, toiling out there till old age and then coming home to spin out the remainder of his life on an inadequate pension. A man who accepts service in India should make up his mind to live and die in the country but so many accidents may prevent it. And at the best it means banishment from England and all one's friends and relations. Poor Margaret feels that severely I am sure!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23050",NA,"""Has Mrs. Pullen many relations then?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23051",NA,"""She has a mother still living and several brothers and sisters besides her husband's family. What a sweet gentle woman she is! She was kind to you, Hally, was she not, whilst you were abroad?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23052",NA,"By mutual agreement they never spoke of Heyst, or the Red House, or anything which was associated with what Pennell called his wife's infatuation regarding herself.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23053",NA,"""Yes! she was very kind-at first,"" replied Harriet, ""until-until-it all happened, and they went to England. O! do not let us talk of it!"" she broke off suddenly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23054",NA,"""No! we will not! Have you unpacked your mandoline yet, Hally? Fetch it, dear, and let me hear your lovely voice again! I shall get you to sing to me when I am in the vein for composing! You would bring me all sorts of beautiful ideas and phantasies!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23055",NA,"""Should I? should I?"" exclaimed the girl joyfully. ""O! how lovely! I should do a part of your work then, shouldn't I, Tony?-I should inspire you! Why, I would sing day and night for that!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23056",NA,"""No! no! my bird, I would not let you tire yourself! A few notes now and then-they will help me more than enough. I must draw from you for my next heroine, Hally! I could not have a fairer model!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23057",NA,"""O! Tony!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23058",NA,"She rushed to him in the extremity of her delight and hid her face upon his breast.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23059",NA,"""I am not good enough, not pretty enough! Your heroines should be perfect!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23060",NA,"""I don't think so! I prefer them to be of flesh and blood, like you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23061",NA,"He stooped his head and kissed her passionately. ""Hally! Hally!"" he whispered, ""you draw my very life away!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23062",NA,"The girl got up suddenly, almost roughly, and walked into the next room to fetch her mandoline.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23063",NA,"""No! no!"" she cried to herself with a cold fear, ""not that, my God, not that!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23064",NA,"But when she returned with the instrument she did not revert to the subject, but played and sang as usual to her husband's admiration and delight.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23065",NA,"They did Florence very thoroughly during the first week of their stay there, and were both completely tired.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23066",NA,"""I must really stay at home to-morrow,"" cried Hally one afternoon on returning to dinner, ""Tony, I am regularly fagged out! I feel as if I had a corn upon every toe!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23067",NA,"""So do I,"" replied her husband, ""and I cannot have my darling knocked-up by fatigue! We will be lazy to-morrow, Hally, and lie on two sofas and read our books all day! I have been thinking for the last few days that we have been going a little too fast! Let me see child!-how long have we been married?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23068",NA,"""Six weeks to-morrow,"" she answered glibly.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23069",NA,"""Bless my soul! we are quite an old married couple, a species of Darby and Joan! And have you been happy, Hally?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23070",NA,"The tears of excitement rushed into her dark eyes.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23071",NA,"""Happy! That is no word for what I have been, Tony, I have been in Heaven-in Heaven all the while!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23072",NA,"""And so have I,"" rejoined her husband.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23073",NA,"""I met some nuns whilst I was out this morning,"" continued Hally, ""the sisters of the Annunciation, and they stopped and spoke to me, and were so pleased to hear that I had been brought up in a convent. 'And have you no vocation, my child?' asked one of them. 'Yes! Sister,' I replied, 'I have-a big, strong, handsome vocation called my husband.' They looked quite shocked, poor dears, at first, but I gave them a subscription for their orphan schools-one hundred francs-and they were so pleased. They said if I was sick whilst in Florence I must send for one of them and she would come and nurse me! I gave it as a thanksgiving, Tony-a thanksgiving offering because I am so very happy. I am not a good woman like Margaret Pullen, I know that, but I love you-I love you!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23074",NA,"""Who said that you were not a good woman?"" asked Pennell, as he drew her fondly to his side, and kissed away the tears that hung on her dark lashes.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23075",NA,"""O! I know I am not. Besides, you once said that Margaret Pullen was the best woman you had ever known.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23076",NA,"""I think she is very sweet and unselfish,"" replied Pennell musingly, ""she felt the loss of her infant terribly, Doctor Phillips told me, but the way in which she struggled to subdue her grief in order not to distress others was wonderful! Poor Margaret! how she mourns little Ethel to this day.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23077",NA,"""Don't! don't!"" cried Harriet in a stifled voice, ""I cannot bear to think of it!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23078",NA,"""My darling, it had nothing to do with you! I have told you so a thousand times!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23079",NA,"""Yes! yes! I know you have-but I loved the little darling! It is dreadful to me to think that she is mouldering in the grave!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23080",NA,"""Come, child, you will be hysterical if you indulge in any more reminiscences! Suppose we go for a stroll through the Ghetto or some other antiquated part of Florence. Or shall we take a drive into the country? I am at your command, Madam!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23081",NA,"""A drive, darling, then-a drive!"" whispered his wife, as she left him to get ready for the excursion.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23082",NA,"It was three hours before they returned to their rooms in the old palazzo. Harriet was dull and somewhat silent and Anthony confessed to a headache.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23083",NA,"""I am not quite sure now,"" he said, as they were dining, ""whether a trip to Australia or America would not do us both more good than lingering about these mild, warm places. I think our constitutions both require bracing rather than coddling. Australia is a grand young country! I have often contemplated paying her a visit. What would you say to it, Hally?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23084",NA,"""I should enjoy it as much as yourself, Tony! You so often have a headache now! I think the drainage of these southern towns must be defective!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23085",NA,"""O! shocking! They are famous for typhoid and malarial fevers. They are not drained at all!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23086",NA,"""Don't let us stay here long then! What should I do if you were to fall ill?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23087",NA,"""You are far more liable to fall sick of the two, my darling,"" returned her husband. ""I do not think your beautiful little body has much strength to sustain it. And then what should I do?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23088",NA,"""Ah! neither of us could do without the other, Tony!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23089",NA,"""Of course we couldn't, and so we will provide against such a contingency by moving on before our systems get saturated with miasma and mistral. Will you sing to me to-night, Hally?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23090",NA,"""Not unless you very much wish it! I am a little tired. I feel as if I couldn't throw any expression into my songs to-night!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23091",NA,"""Then come here and sit down on the sofa beside me, and let us talk!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23092",NA,"She did as he desired but Pennell was too sleepy to talk. In five minutes he had fallen fast asleep and it was with difficulty she could persuade him to abandon the couch and drag his weary limbs up to bed, where he threw himself down in a profound slumber. Harriet was also tired. Her husband was breathing heavily as she slipped into her place beside him. His arm was thrown out over her pillow, as though he feared she might go to sleep without remembering to wish him good-night! She bent over him and kissed him passionately on the lips.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23093",NA,"""Good-night, my beloved,"" she whispered, ""sleep well and wake in happiness!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23094",NA,"She kissed the big hand too that lay upon her pillow and composed herself to sleep while it still encircled her.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23095",NA,"The dawn is early in Florence but it had broken for some time before she roused herself again. The sun was streaming brightly into the long, narrow, uncurtained windows and everything it lighted on was touched with a molten glory. Harriet started up in bed. Her husband's arm was still beneath her body.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23096",NA,"""O! my poor darling!"" she exclaimed, as though the fault were her own, ""how cramped he must be! How soundly we must have slept not to have once moved through the night!""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23097",NA,"She raised Tony's arm and commenced to chafe it. How strangely heavy and cold it felt. Why! he was cold all over! She drew up the bedclothes and tucked them in around his chin. Then, for the first time, she looked at his face. His eyes were open.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23098",NA,"""Tony, Tony!"" she exclaimed, ""are you making fun of me? Have you been awake all the time?""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23099",NA,"She bent over his face laughingly and pressed a kiss upon his cheek.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23100",NA,"How stiff it felt! My God! what was the matter? Could he have fainted? She leapt from the bed, and running to her husband's side, pulled down the bedclothes again and placed her hand upon his heart. The body was cold-cold and still all over! His eyes were glazed and dull. His mouth was slightly open. In one awful moment she knew the truth. Tony was-dead!","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23101",NA,"She stood for some moments-some hours-some months-she could not have reckoned the time, silent and motionless, trying to realise what had occurred. Then-as it came upon her, like a resistless flood which she could not stem nor escape, Harriet gave one fearful shriek which brought the servants hurrying upstairs to know what could be the matter.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23102",NA,"""I have killed my husband-I have killed him-it was I myself who did it!"" was all that she would say.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23103",NA,"Of course they did not believe her. They accepted the unmeaning words as part of their mistress's frenzy at her sudden and unexpected loss. They saw what had happened, and they ran breathlessly for a doctor who confirmed their worst fears-the Signor was dead!","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23104",NA,"The old palazzo became like a disturbed ant-hill. The servants ran hither and thither, unknowing how to act, whilst the mistress sat by the bedside with staring, tearless eyes, holding the hand of her dead husband. But there were a dozen things to be done-half a hundred orders to be issued. Death in Florence is quickly followed by burial. The law does not permit a mourner to lament his Dead for more than four-and-twenty hours.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23105",NA,"But the signora would give no orders for the funeral nor answer any questions put to her! She had no friends in Florence-for ought they knew, she had no money-what were they to do? At last one of them thought of the neighbouring Convent of the Annunciation and ran to implore one of the good sisters to come to their mistress in her extremity.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23106",NA,"Shortly afterwards, Sister Angelica entered the bedroom where Harriet sat murmuring at intervals, ""It is I who have killed him,"" and attempted to administer comfort to the young mourner. But her words and prayers had no effect upon Harriet. Her brain could hold but one idea-she had killed Tony! Doctor Phillips was right-it was she who had killed Margaret Pullen's baby and Bobby Bates, and to look further back, little Caroline, and now-now her Tony! the light of her life, the passion of her being, the essence of all her joy-her hope for this world and the next. She had killed him-she, who worshipped him, whose pride was bound up in him, who was to have helped him and comforted him and waited on him all his life-she had killed him!","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23107",NA,"Her dry lips refused to say the words distinctly, but they kept revolving in her brain until they dazed and wearied her. The little sister stood by her and held her hand as the professional assistants entered the death chamber and arranged and straightened the body for the grave, finally placing it in a coffin and carrying it away to a mortuary where it would have to remain until buried on the morrow, but Harriet made no resistance to the ceremony and no sign. She did not even say ""Good-bye"" as Tony was carried from her sight for ever! Sister Angelica talked to her of the glorious Heaven where they must hope that her dear husband would be translated, of the peace and happiness he would enjoy, of the reunion which awaited them when her term of life was also past.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23108",NA,"She pressed her to make the Convent her refuge until the first agony of her loss was overcome-reminded her of the peace and rest she would encounter within the cloisters, and how the whole fraternity would unite in praying for the soul of her beloved that he might speedily obtain the remission of his sins and an entrance into the Beatific Presence.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23109",NA,"Harriet listened dully and at last in order to get rid of her well-intentioned but rather wearisome consoler, she promised to do all that she wished. Let the sister return to the Convent for the present, and on the morrow if she would come for her at the same time she might take her back with her. She wanted rest and peace-she would be thankful for them, poor Harriet said-only-to-night, this one night more, she wished to be alone. So the good little sister went away rejoicing that she had succeeded in her errand of mercy, and looking forward to bearing the poor young widow to the Convent on the morrow, there to learn the true secret of earthly happiness.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23110",NA,"When she had gone and the old palazzo was quiet and empty, the bewildered girl rose to her feet and tried to steady her shaking limbs sufficiently to write what seemed to be a letter but was in reality a will.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23111",NA,"""I leave all that I possess,"" so it ran, ""to Margaret Pullen, the wife of Colonel Arthur Pullen, the best woman Tony said that he had ever met, and I beg her to accept it in return for the kindness she shewed to me when I went to Heyst, a stranger. Signed, HARRIET PENNELL.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23112",NA,"She put the paper into an envelope and as soon as the morning had dawned she asked her servant Lorenzo to shew her the way to the nearest notary in whose presence she signed the document and directed him to whom it should be sent in case of her own death.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23113",NA,"And after another visit to a pharmacien, she returned to the Palazzo and took up her watch again in the now deserted bedchamber.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23114",NA,"Her servants brought her refreshments and pressed her to eat without effect. All she desired, she told them, was to be left alone until the sister came for her in the afternoon.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23115",NA,"Sister Angelica arrived true to her appointment and went at once to the bedchamber. To her surprise she found Harriet lying on the bed, just where the corpse of Anthony Pennell had lain, and apparently asleep.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23116",NA,"""Pauvre enfant!"" thought the kind-hearted nun, ""grief has exhausted her! I should not have attended to her request, but have watched with her through the night! Eh donc, ma pauvre,"" she continued, gently touching the girl on the shoulder, ""levez-vous! Je suis ici.""[132]","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23117",NA,"But there was no awakening on this earth for Harriet Pennell. She had taken a dose of chloral and joined her husband.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23118",NA,"When Margaret Pullen received the will which Harriet had left behind her, she found these words with it, scribbled in a very trembling hand upon a scrap of paper.","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23119",NA,"""Do not think more unkindly of me than you can help. My parents have made me unfit to live. Let me go to a world where the curse of heredity which they laid upon me may be mercifully wiped out.""","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
"23120",NA,"THE END","Marryat, Florence","The Blood of the Vampire"
