151,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods,58,Castle Dracula,location

192,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me but on making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent and pretended that he could not understand my German,85,Count Dracula,person

241,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,I dined on what they called robber steakbits of bacon onion and beef seasoned with red pepper and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire in the simple style of the London cats meat,120,London,location
242,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,The wine was Golden Mediasch which produces a queer sting on the tongue which is however not disagreeable,121,NA,NA
243,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,I had only a couple of glasses of this and nothing else,122,NA,NA
244,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat and I saw him talking with the landlady,123,NA,NA
245,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,They were evidently talking of me for every now and then they looked at me and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the doorwhich they call by a name meaning wordbearercame and listened and then looked at me most of them pityingly,124,NA,NA
246,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,I could hear a lot of words often repeated queer words for there were many nationalities in the crowd so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out,125,NA,NA
248,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula, Mem  I must ask the Count about these superstitions  When we started the crowd round the inn door which had by this time swelled to a considerable size all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me,127,Count Dracula,person
251,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,With some difficulty I got a fellowpassenger to tell me what they meant he would not answer at first but on learning that I was English he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye,128,NA,NA
253,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the innyard and its crowd of picturesque figures all crossing themselves as they stood round the wide archway with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard,130,NA,NA
254,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,Then our driver whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the boxseatgotza they call themcracked his big whip over his four small horses which ran abreast and we set off on our journey,131,NA,NA
257,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossomapple plum pear cherry and as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals,134,NA,NA
259,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,The road was rugged but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste,136,NA,NA
260,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,I could not understand then what the haste meant but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund,137,NA,NA
261,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,I was told that this road is in summertime excellent but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows,138,NA,NA
262,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order,139,Carpathian,location
264,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves,141,Carpathian,location
267,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains through which as the sun began to sink we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water,143,NA,NA
270,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,As we wound on our endless way and the sun sank lower and lower behind us the shadows of the evening began to creep round us,146,NA,NA
271,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,This was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountaintop still held the sunset and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink,147,NA,NA
272,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,Here and there we passed Cszeks and Slovaks all in picturesque attire but I noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent,148,NA,NA
273,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,By the roadside were many crosses and as we swept by my companions all crossed themselves,149,NA,NA
274,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine who did not even turn round as we approached but seemed in the selfsurrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world,150,NA,NA
275,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,There were many things new to me for instance hayricks in the trees and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves,151,NA,NA
277,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,On this were sure to be seated quite a group of homecoming peasants the Cszeks with their white and the Slovaks with their coloured sheepskins the latter carrying lancefashion their long staves with axe at end,153,NA,NA
279,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,Sometimes as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us great masses of greyness which here and there bestrewed the trees produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghostlike clouds which amongst the Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys,155,Carpathian,location
284,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,I wished to get down and walk up them as we do at home but the driver would not hear of it,157,NA,NA
285,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,No no he said you must not walk here the dogs are too fierce and then he added with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantryfor he looked round to catch the approving smile of the restand you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep,158,NA,NA
286,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,The only stop he would make was a moments pause to light his ,159,NA,NA
287,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,lamps,160,NA,NA
288,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers and they kept speaking to him one after the other as though urging him to further speed,161,NA,NA
289,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,He lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions,162,NA,NA
292,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,I had to hold on,165,NA,NA
293,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,The road grew more level and we appeared to fly along,166,NA,NA
294,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us we were entering on the Borgo Pass,167,NA,NA
295,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial these were certainly of an odd and varied kind but each was given in simple good faith with a kindly word and a blessing and that strange mixture of fearmeaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritzthe sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye,168,Bistritz,location
296,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,Then as we flew along the driver leaned forward and on each side the passengers craning over the edge of the coach peered eagerly into the darkness,169,NA,NA
297,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected but though I asked each passenger no one would give me the slightest explanation,170,NA,NA
298,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,This state of excitement kept on for some little time and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern side,171,NA,NA
299,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,There were dark rolling clouds overhead and in the air the heavy oppressive sense of thunder,172,NA,NA
300,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres and that now we had got into the thunderous one,173,NA,NA
301,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the Count,174,Count Dracula,person
303,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness but all was dark,175,NA,NA
304,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps in which the steam from our harddriven horses rose in a white cloud,176,NA,NA
305,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,We could see now the sandy road lying white before us but there was on it no sign of a vehicle,177,NA,NA
306,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness which seemed to mock my own disappointment,178,NA,NA
307,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,I was already thinking what I had best do when the driver looking at his watch said to the others something which I could hardly hear it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone I thought it was An hour less than the time,179,NA,NA
308,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,Then turning to me he said in German worse than my own  There is no carriage here,180,NA,NA
309,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,The Herr is not expected after all,181,NA,NA
311,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly so that the driver had to hold them up,183,NA,NA
312,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,Then amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves a calèche with four horses drove up behind us overtook us and drew up beside the coach,184,NA,NA
313,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,I could see from the flash of our lamps as the rays fell on them that the horses were coalblack and splendid animals,185,NA,NA
314,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,They were driven by a tall man with a long brown beard and a great black hat which seemed to hide his face from us,186,NA,NA

351,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,This time after going to the far side of the Pass he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right,218,NA,NA

369,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,sped onwards through the gloom with the howling of the wolves around us as though they were following in a moving circle,235,NA,NA
370,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone and during his absence the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright,236,NA,NA
371,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,I could not see any cause for it for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether but just then the moon sailing through the black clouds appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling pineclad rock and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves with white teeth and lolling red tongues with long sinewy limbs and shaggy hair,237,Moon,location

377,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,I called to the coachman to come for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach,243,NA,NA

379,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,How he came there I know not but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command and looking towards the sound saw him stand in the roadway,245,NA,NA
380,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,As he swept his long arms as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle the wolves fell back and back further still,246,NA,NA
381,"Stoker, Bram",Dracula,Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon so that we were again in darkness,247,Moon,location
